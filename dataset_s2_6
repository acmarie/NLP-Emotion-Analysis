They both have it the worst. Or maybe close to the worst. \n\nIn the US most minimum wage workers/food service workers receive ZERO vacation or sick time days. To make matters even more miserable. Scheduling for these jobs has become last minute due to software time management systems and the fact that everyone can run an app on their phone. So what happens is that big popular restaurant will call in a worker at the last second. And this can happen pretty much anytime. And if you don\u2019t respond to enough shift requests? Well then maybe they stop scheduling you. If I remember correctly there was a big lawsuit over this and the idea of being \u201con call\u201d but that\u2019s a different discussion. \n\nSo even IF you have a block of time scheduled off. And even IF you are lucky to get sick during it. There is a good chance you might get called in at the last minute to cover the last 4 hours of Dave\u2019s shift because guess what? He quit or left or died of coronavirus or something. \n\nSo now you\u2019re spreading germs because you have no time off ever. And if you don\u2019t play nice food service employee. Well you won\u2019t be fired. But you\u2019ll never get scheduled. \n\nAnd then there is my favorite. Nurses. Who take care of us every hour of the day when we need it most. They spend 12 plus hour shifts at ground zero of some of the nastiest shit you\u2019d ever be infected with. I worked IT in a hospital once. For two years I was sick with something. Once one germ passed another one took hold. \n\nAnyway so for nurses, a lot of the rules surrounding their employment give very few days they can call off at the last minute. In Chicago they passed a sick day law thankfully. But before that I know if you called off work more than two times in a single year you were let go. So not only do nurses end up sick more often than regular jobs. But then we also give them some of the strictest policies for using sick time. I know not every hospital has the same policy. For instance now in Chicago we have mandated sick day minimums. But still it\u2019s like that in a lot of places. \n\nCorona virus is transmittable for what, two weeks?

They also apparently attended a pre-dance gathering at the house of a Villa student.\nSt. Louis County Executive Sam Page said Sunday that the patient\u2019s family had been told on Thursday to self quarantine at their home in Ladue. Page said the patient\u2019s father had not followed health department instructions. Page spoke at a news conference Sunday evening.\n\nCounty health officials told the man on Sunday, Page said, \u201cthat he must remain in his home or they will issue a formal quarantine that will require him and the rest of his family to stay in their home by the force of law.\u201d\n\nThe Villa Duchesne message advises students and parents, \u201cIf you attended the dance, please be attentive to any symptoms you are experiencing.\u201d\nThe schools are independent Catholic schools in Frontenac. Villa is an all-girls school for grades seven through 12, while Oak Hill serves coed preschoolers through sixth graders.\n\nA \u201chandful\u201d of seniors from John Burroughs School also may have been exposed to the virus Saturday when they gathered at the house where the pre-dance event had been held earlier, according to an email sent Sunday night by Andy Abbott, head of John Burroughs School. The family who lives at that house includes children who attend Villa and Burroughs.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of any of the Burroughs students contracting the virus is extraordinarily low,\u201d Abbott wrote, adding that the students have been asked not to attend school \u201cuntil we have more information.\u201d\nBurroughs has canceled its spring break trip to Italy, Abbott said.\nWith Missouri\u2019s first COVID-19 case confirmed on Saturday, health officials began the tedious work of determining with whom the woman had close contact since returning home from Italy.\n\nThe woman, in her 20s, flew into Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport on Monday, stayed with a friend, then took an Amtrak train home to St. Louis on Wednesday, according to Doug Moore, spokesman for Page. The woman attends an out-of-state school and had been studying abroad.\nBecause she was starting to feel ill, the woman contacted the St. Louis County Department of Public Health on Thursday, Moore said. She apparently stayed home and did not have contact with anyone until she was instructed on Friday to go to Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur for testing.\n\nHospital staff were notified before the woman arrived, so they were able to protect themselves and isolate her from others.\n\n\nOfficials had said the woman was quarantining herself, along with her parents, who were not showing symptoms. But on Sunday, reports about the father-daughter dance began circulating.\n\u201cWe are communicating with the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and sharing everything that we know with them,\u201d stated Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill communications director Alice Dickherber in an email. \u201cWe will work with officials to ensure we are doing everything possible to mitigate risk and to maintain our safe environment.

Page said it is \u201chighly likely\u201d the CDC will confirm it.\nAmtrak 303\nOn Sunday, Amtrak issued a news release stating that the woman had been on Amtrak train 303. \u201cAmtrak is notifying passengers and employees who may have been on the same train, and as a precaution, we have taken the train out of service for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection, and are also working to do a thorough disinfection of the Chicago and St. Louis stations,\u201d the statement read.\nThe downtown St. Louis station, called the Gateway Transportation Center, is also a hub for Greyhound, Megabus and Metro St. Louis. \u201cThe Gateway Transportation Center is following guidelines to assure the cleanliness of our facility,\u201d St. Louis Comptroller Darlene Green\u2019s office stated in an email.\n\nInvestigators with the county health department spent several hours Saturday interviewing the woman to determine whether she might have had close contact with anyone else who could be at risk.\n\n\u201cWe go through an extensive interviewing process with the person,\u201d that follows CDC protocols, said Spring Schmidt, acting co-director of the county health department. \u201cWe spent several hours with her yesterday going over her movements and travel history \u2026 . It\u2019s a difficult process that requires a lot of careful interviewing and coaching and memory prompts.\u201d\nAs investigators learn more, Schmidt said, they are in contact with CDC officials to determine how far back they should document the woman\u2019s movements, who\u2019s at risk of exposure and what other health agencies outside of the county may need to be involved.\n\nThe process of determining who needs to be notified, checked for symptoms and tested is unfolding, Schmidt said. Those contacts may lead to more investigations, as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cascading series of potential calls,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until it starts to move forward and it continues to generate potential contact.\u201d\n\nState health department director Dr. Randall Williams was working Sunday alongside county health officials.\n\u201cWe are providing extra boots on the ground here.

The other locations include Cameron, Cape Girardeau, Mexico, Mount Vernon, St. James and Warrensburg.\n\nNo visitors, vendors nor volunteers are allowed in the facilities until further notice, according to the commission\u2019s website. Staff is helping families communicate with each other via video chat services.\nStarting Monday, Williams said, testing kits for COVID-19 will be available commercially. Physicians can order tests for their patients who they determine could be at risk, he said, without having to consult public health officials or meet CDC guidelines that include travel history, known contact and symptoms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s between the physician and the patient,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou can go to the doctor tomorrow and say, \u2018I want a test,\u2019 and they don\u2019t have to use the CDC criteria to order it.\u201d\n\n\nUsing a specific throat swab, doctors can send the sample to a diagnostic lab for testing, Williams said. All positive cases must be reported to local health departments.\nThat could mean a dramatic increase in the number of cases reported, Williams acknowledged. With $9.9 million that Missouri will receive under emergency federal legislation approved last week, he said, public health staff will be able to adapt.\n\n\u201cWe are clearly prepared,\u201d he said.\nSt. Louis County has partly activated its emergency operations center in Ballwin, bringing together public health experts, paramedics, police, public information officers and hospital officials to provide the latest information and coordinate efforts.\nThe center has been activated during natural disasters and other threats, such as the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009.

Duterte has always threatened disobeying local officials of charging them with dereliction of duty.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has even cited Republic Act 11332 or the broad Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases which punishes 'non-cooperation' in a health emergency.\n\nThe DOJ even said warrantless arrests can be implemented under this law.\n\n\"That being said, much of those enumerated in sec. 6 are already prohibited by special laws or punished as felonies,\" said Te. \u2013 Rappler.com", "created_utc": 1585095595, "complete": true, "id": "flf0xf3", "link_id": "t3_fo8jng"}, {"parent_id": "t3_pdae9", "subreddit": "atheism", "author": "orrery", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "* [Top 30 Big Bang Problems](http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/BB-top-30.asp)\n\n* Cosmology Quest [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6EGpg_BVBg), [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=t7uT0JuKT8Q#t=1s)\n\n* [What Laboratory-Produced Plasma Structures Can Contribute to the Understanding of Cosmic Structures](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4316621)\n\n* [21st Century Cosmology](http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toaaj/articles/V004/SI0162TOAAJ/191TOAAJ.pdf)\n\n* [NASA Lecturer Dr. Scott on Plasma Physics solutions to Cosmological Questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8tqgntbjyE)\n\n* [On Gravity-centric Cosmology and the Implications of a Universe Awash with Plasma](http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toaaj/articles/V004/SI0162TOAAJ/165TOAAJ.pdf)\n\n* [Other Selected References](http://www.bigbangneverhappened.org/p15.htm)\n\n* [Redshift as a Consequence of Electron Plasma. Compton scattering on the individual electrons, and Raman scattering on the plasma frequency.](http://www.plasmaredshift.org)\n\n&gt; A new interaction, plasma redshift, is derived, which is important only when photons penetrate a hot, sparse electron plasma.  The derivation of plasma redshift is based entirely on conventional axioms of physics.  When photons penetrate a cold and dense plasma, they lose energy through ionization and excitation, Compton scattering on the individual electrons, and Raman scattering on the plasma frequency.  But in sparse hot plasma, such as in the solar corona, the photons lose energy also in plasma redshift.  The energy loss per electron in the plasma redshift is about equal to the product of the photon's energy and one half of the Compton cross-section per electron.  In quiescent solar corona, this heating starts in the transition zone to the corona and is a major fraction of the coronal heating.  Plasma redshift contributes also to the heating of the interstellar plasma, the galactic corona, and the intergalactic plasma.  Plasma redshift explains the solar redshifts, the intrinsic redshifts of stars, quasars, the galactic corona, the cosmological redshifts, the cosmic microwave background, and the X-ray background.  The plasma redshift explains the observed magnitude-redshift relation for supernovae SNe Ia without the big bang, dark matter, or dark energy.  It explains also the observed surface brightness of galaxies.  There is no cosmic time dilation.  The universe is not expanding. The plasma redshift, when compared with experiments, shows that the photons' classical gravitational redshifts are reversed as the photons move from the Sun to the Earth, provided they have adequate time to change their frequency.  This is a quantum mechanical effect.  As seen from the Earth, a repulsion force acts on the photons.  \n\n&gt; This means that there is no need for Einstein's Lambda term.  The universe is quasi-static, infinite, and everlasting.  The universe can renew itself forever.\n\n* Dark Glow Electron Plasma Flux Tubes carrying Galactic Clusters *to &amp; from* Supercluster Complexes such as the Great Attractor.\n\n* Dark Glow Electron Plasma as measured by [GOES Electron Monitoring Station](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/rt_plots/elec_3d.html) and Voyager probes.\n\n* Space Age failure to detect an interstellar or interplanetary vacuum disproves [Michelson-Morley Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) conclusions and all theoretical sciences derived as a consequence of it.\n\n* [r/plasmacosmology](http://www.reddit.com/r/plasmacosmology)", "created_utc": 1328545125, "complete": true, "id": "c3ofq6s", "link_id": "t3_pdae9"}, {"parent_id": "t3_7vuh9", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author": "flibbertigibbit", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Your resort is probably all-inclusive, so it goes without saying you should take full advantage of that.

He told Abu Safiya that he had been showing signs of the coronavirus over the past four days, and was recently tested for the virus. That test later came back negative.\u00a0\n\nBut before the man, allegedly a resident of Nablus,\u00a0could receive his test results,\u00a0his Israeli employer reportedly called the\u00a0authorities, who picked him up and dropped him on the other side of the Beit Sira checkpoint, which connects central Israel and the occupied West Bank.\u00a0\n\n\"He told us that they just threw him here on the ground\u00a0and left him,\"\u00a0Abu Safiya recounted.\n\n\"How could they do this to someone?\"\u00a0he asked. \"It shouldn't matter if he's Palestinian, Israeli, or whatever. He's a human being.\"\n\nLeft stranded at the border\n\nWhen Abu Safiya and his friend came upon the man, whose identity remains\u00a0unknown, they began filming a video\u00a0which has now gone viral on Palestinian social media.\n\nAbu Safiya said he feared they were witnessing a repeat of events from just one day before.\u00a0\n\nHe alleges that over the weekend, another Palestinian labourer, who suspected he himself had contracted the virus, travelled alone to the Beit Sira checkpoint in order to cross back into the West Bank.\u00a0\n\nWhen the man got there, he informed locals of his condition, upon which they called the Palestinian emergency services, who were supposed to send an ambulance to pick him up.\n\n[\ufffc](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/occupation-palestine-nilin-killed-israel-army-coronavirus)\n\n'We lost him': West Bank village in shock as Israeli army kills Palestinian\n\n[Read More \u00bb](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/occupation-palestine-nilin-killed-israel-army-coronavirus)\n\nJust days earlier, Israel had approved\u00a0[the entry of thousands of Palestinian labourers into the country,](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-palestine-workers-israel-bethlehem-choice-livelihood-isolation)\u00a0under the condition that they had to stay in Israel for at least a month\u00a0to prevent the spread of the virus in the West Bank.\u00a0\n\nAs part of the agreement with the PA, upon their return, to be coordinated with Israeli authorities, any workers would be immediately put into a 14-day quarantine.\u00a0\n\n\"But the fact that two workers have come, or been dumped here at the nearest checkpoint, with no notice, and clearly no coordination, is very worrying,\"\u00a0Abu Safiya said.\u00a0\n\nWhile the PA spokesman Ibrahim Melhem\u00a0[announced](http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=eYtSXVa115488564279aeYtSXV)\u00a0that the ill worker was \"handed\"\u00a0to Palestinian officials at the checkpoint on Monday, Abu Safiya said that was absolutely not the case.\u00a0\n\n\"Neither the man today or yesterday were dropped off [by Israeli forces] to a [Palestinian] ambulance,\" he said, adding that in both cases, Palestinian medics took almost three hours to arrive from Ramallah to Beit Sira.\n\n\"The Palestinian government needs to properly coordinate with the Israeli side to prevent this from happening again,\"\u00a0he said. \"They can't just keep dropping people off here without any help.\"\n\n'The true face of the Israeli occupation'\n\nDespite his shock at seeing a sick man being \"left to die\"\u00a0at a checkpoint, Abu Safiya said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the incident.\u00a0\n\n\"This is the true face of the Israeli occupation,\"\u00a0he told MEE. \"They kill us on a daily basis, so this isn't any different for them.\"\n\nThe video filmed by Abu Safiya and his friend went viral on Palestinian social media on Monday, as people expressed their outrage over the treatment of the worker.\u00a0\n\nAbu Safiya says the reasons it's struck a chord with so many people is because \"it is evident of the larger problem of how Israel treats Palestinian labourers and [how] little they value our lives,\"\u00a0he said.\n\n'It's like we are slaves to them ...

Instead, they should follow advice for everyone else to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19.\n\nAre HIV positive people at greater risk of COVID-19?\nHIV organizations appear to agree that HIV positive people are not necessarily at greater risk.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Terrence Higgins Trust (THT) says:\n\n\u2018There\u2019s currently no evidence that people living with HIV are any more likely to catch COVID-19 than anyone else. You should follow the advice being given to the general population. \n\n\u2018If you are on treatment, with an undetectable viral load and a good CD4 count (eg over 400), then there should be no greater risk. \n\n\u2018If you\u2019re living with HIV and do not have an undetectable viral load or have a low CD4 count, it will be more important to avoid situations where you may get infected if the virus becomes more widespread.\u2019\n\nHowever, some HIV positive people are more likely to suffer from other health conditions. And anyone who has cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, asthma and diabetes appears to be at greater risk from coronavirus.\n\nStick to general advise and wash your hands\nOrganizations including THT and the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO) offer this general advice:\n\nLike everyone, wash your hands more regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze.\nPut any used tissues into the bin immediately.\nAvoid touching your face, particularly your nose, mouth and eyes.\nTry to avoid close contact with people who are unwell.\nIf you are unwell, avoid contact with others (touching, kissing, hugging and other intimate contact) and check the latest official advice on seeing a doctor or self-isolating.\nUse hand-sanitizer if it is not possible to wash your hands.\nIn addition, they ask people who have recently returned from a high risk area to stay indoors and avoid contact with others.\n\nAFAO adds: \u2018While there is usually no need to stock-pile shop-bought medicines like paracetamol and ibuprofen, If you are taking medication, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure you have at least one month\u2019s supply.\n\n\u2018This is because you may need to stay at home if you feel unwell. Talk with your doctor if you need extra scripts.\n\n\u2018If you are taking PrEP (for HIV prevention) and are concerned about maintaining your three-monthly doctor\u2019s appointments, talk to your doctor for more options.\u2019\n\nAnd AFAO also advises people who are HIV positive to get a regular flu jab. It will become available in Australia in April.\n\nThe flu jab will not protect you from COVID-19 which is a very different virus.\n\nBut AFAO says: \u2018It is good to avoid having both viruses together, or one after the other. The flu vaccine provides good protection against influenza and is recommended each year for all people living with HIV.\u2019\n\nPromising results but no proof\nMeanwhile, in the US, amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, has reported on the attempts to use HIV drugs against COVID-19.\n\nResearchers have been trialling various drugs in the hopes that something already on the market may help fight the coronavirus.\n\namfAR says: \u2018Physicians in Thailand and Japan have reported using the antiretroviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir to fight the novel coronavirus, with apparent success.\n\n\u2018Thai doctors gave the two HIV drugs in combination with a large dose of the flu drug oseltamivir to a Chinese coronavirus patient. She tested negative for the coronavirus within two days.\n\n\u2018In Japan, a patient from Wuhan, China \u2013 the epicenter of the epidemic \u2013 was treated with just the two HIV drugs. Despite some trouble breathing, the patient stabilized after treatment, and her fever subsided within five days of being admitted.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile China is also testing the safety and effectiveness of lopinavir and ritonavir in treating coronavirus. And in Hong Kong researchers are interested in using the HIV drugs in combination with immune-enhancing interferon.\n\nMoreover, the scientists also note that in 2004, people with SARS, a related coronavirus, seemed to benefit from HIV drugs.\n\nNo evidence HIV drugs work yet\nHowever, public health experts caution they need to do much more testing before concluding HIV drugs can fight COVID-19.\n\nAnd they are looking at other options including pharmaceutical company Gilead\u2019s drug, Remdesivir. It was designed to fight Ebola but didn\u2019t work. However, it may be effective against coronavirus.\n\nPublic health experts caution they need to do more tests before they will know if HIV drugs can effectively treat the coronavirus.\n\nSo far, you should remember there is no firm evidence that HIV drugs treat COVID-19. Likewise, there is no evidence that being on anti-viral medication for HIV (including PrEP), hepatitis C or hepatitis B, protects you from coronavirus.", "created_utc": 1584188966, "complete": true, "id": "fkh568y", "link_id": "t3_fihifv"}, {"parent_id": "t3_fkqarp", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author": "HoyMinyoy", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": true, "fear": true, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": true}, "body": "NEWS WE\u2019VE MISSED DUE TO COVID-19:\n\n - A 2nd person was cured of HIV in the UK\n\n - Russian parliament passed a reform allowing Putin to stay president until 2036\n\n - Ethiopia is facing mass starvation due to swarms of locusts the size of cities.

You can\u2019t expect the teachers to spoon feed detailed lesson plans and activities to the extent they would\u2019ve done in the classroom. Lots of activities that teachers do are group-based and children learn from each other. This type of teaching and learning will not be the same. The teachers are doing their best to provide resources, but short of having the teacher do an interactive Skype lesson for the whole day, every day, parents need to understand that kids are going to fall behind and most likely will need to repeat their year, if this goes on for 3-6 months. \n\nWe either need to take two stances:\n(1) Close schools and keep children in isolation with basic learning while their parents continue to work/work from home\n(2) Keep schools open so children continue their curriculum learning from their teacher \n\nThe consequences of (2) is that the virus will spread throughout the community, and the consequence of (1) is that children will fall behind. Both consequences cannot possibly be mitigated.

The host Steve Bannon (Trump chief campaign advisor) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the Xi/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.\n\nI suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasin population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go \"super viral\" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantinee and lockdowns of cities of unprecendeted porportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damaage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.\n\nEven the SARS of 2003 had an negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and has already turned out to be far worse and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsuprisingly without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another \"ding\" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilsts at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake \"Trade Deal\" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak. \n\nChina should at least stay vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the \"MAD\" doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more \"plausible deniability\" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the SCS militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of \"other means\" to an ends.. Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to \"thanksgiving\" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Maniesft Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelyhood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and pysops war, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficently weakened.\n\nSteve Bannon was hoping to \"break the back of the CCP\" by cutting off China's supply chain, and was hoping the HK roits was going to catch fire in the rest of the mainland and force the CCP to lose control making it easier to do an opportunistic regime change.\n\nI'm sure both China and US have their own red lines. If the US had any involvement in this new virus, if China finds any credible evidence, then there are a number of things China can do besides retailiting with its own bioweapon... for example, we all know the Trade War is not about trade, but wanting China to slow down in terms of hegemonic rise... for example China could simply start building Huangyan Island in the SCS, making a move that would seal the US fate as the \"falling empire\". If China militarizes the island it would give China total control of the SCS region, so China can declare ADIZ over SCS, America would be pushed back to Guam, and it woulld be the beginning of the end of the petrodollar hegemony (which never could have lasted forever anyway but it would push it up along the timeline to make it collapse that much faster)\n\nSome have said that well the virus is RNA single stranded which makes it harder to target any race specific without mutations losing the specificity over many infections cycles. And that if it were double stranded it would make it that much easier to create vaccines for and kill/contain. But I believe in this case it is about maintaining \"plausible deniability\" whilst not crossing any hard red lines in case attribution is established in the future. A virus outbreak that dings China's GDP by 2 to 5 % in 2020 is not comparable to an end of civilization event that wipes out 90% of the Chinese population, for example. Whatever blowback or collateral risk is considered acceptable levels since it was deployed to China's central Wuhan, naturally China has a self interest in containment, and the vast majority of the damage will be internal to China. It may have been engineerred as race specific single stranded RNA and knowingly by hostile forces that predicted by the time it lost its race specificity that China would have already contained it. Hence \"mission accomplished\" with little attribution and minimal blowback. What better way to undermine China/CCP than to have its population grow resentful of or turn against its very Government!? Already Western media is talking about how Chinese are filthy and if it wasn't for eating rats, bats, dogs, etc this wouldn't ever have befallen. Perfect cover for re-enforceing racists stereotypes for the ulterior motives of containing and isolating China, and that of Chinese culture, and Chinese ideology on the world stage.\n\nAll of this should be seen within the larger context and backdrop of the so called Thucydides's Trap. For various reason, biological warfare against mainland China gives America multiprong strategic and asymmetric advantages, hence why it has now become the method and weapon of choice for the US to use against China. At what point does China take action or else find itself too little and too late to be suffering same fate as Native Americans?

Flush with cash, it became a dominant maker of encryption devices for decades, navigating waves of technology from mechanical gears to electronic circuits and, finally, silicon chips and software.\n\nThe Swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. Its clients included Iran, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican.\n\nBut what none of its customers ever knew was that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. These spy agencies rigged the company\u2019s devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.\n\nThe decades-long arrangement, among the most closely guarded secrets of the Cold War, is laid bare in a classified, comprehensive CIA history of the operation obtained by The Washington Post and ZDF, a German public broadcaster, in a joint reporting project.\n\nThe account identifies the CIA officers who ran the program and the company executives entrusted to execute it. It traces the origin of the venture as well as the internal conflicts that nearly derailed it. It describes how the United States and its allies exploited other nations\u2019 gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.\n\nThe operation, known first by the code name \u201cThesaurus\u201d and later \u201cRubicon,\u201d ranks among the most audacious in CIA history.\n\n\u201cIt was the intelligence coup of the century,\u201d the CIA report concludes. \u201cForeign governments were paying good money to the U.S. and West Germany for the privilege of having their most secret communications read by at least two (and possibly as many as five or six) foreign countries.\u201d\n\nFrom 1970 on, the CIA and its code-breaking sibling, the National Security Agency, controlled nearly every aspect of Crypto\u2019s operations \u2014 presiding with their German partners over hiring decisions, designing its technology, sabotaging its algorithms and directing its sales targets.\n\nThen, the U.S. and West German spies sat back and listened.\n\nThey monitored Iran\u2019s mullahs during [the 1979 hostage crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-444-day-iran-hostage-crisis-began-37-years-ago/2016/11/08/9dc580f4-9482-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html), fed intelligence about Argentina\u2019s military to Britain during [the Falklands War](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/argentine-war-heroes-revealed-to-be-henchmen-in-military-dictatorship/2012/04/05/gIQA1fhoxS_story.html), tracked the assassination campaigns of South American dictators and caught Libyan officials congratulating themselves on [the 1986 bombing of a Berlin disco](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/11/14/4-convicted-in-86-berlin-nightclub-bombing/677c82cd-05ea-413b-a274-1ce261473384/).\n\nThe program had limits. America\u2019s main adversaries, including the Soviet Union and China, were never Crypto customers. Their well-founded suspicions of the company\u2019s ties to the West shielded them from exposure, although the CIA history suggests that U.S. spies learned a great deal by monitoring other countries\u2019 interactions with Moscow and Beijing.\n\nThere were also security breaches that put Crypto under clouds of suspicion. Documents released in the 1970s showed extensive \u2014 and incriminating \u2014 correspondence between an NSA pioneer and Crypto\u2019s founder. Foreign targets were tipped off by the careless statements of public officials including President Ronald Reagan. And the 1992 arrest of a Crypto salesman in Iran, who did not realize he was selling rigged equipment, triggered a devastating \u201cstorm of publicity,\u201d according to the CIA history.\n\nBut the true extent of the company\u2019s relationship with the CIA and its German counterpart was until now never revealed.\n\nThe German spy agency, the BND, came to believe the risk of exposure was too great and left the operation in the early 1990s. But the CIA bought the Germans\u2019 stake and simply kept going, wringing Crypto for all its espionage worth until 2018, when the agency sold off the company\u2019s assets, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe company\u2019s importance to the global security market had fallen by then, squeezed by the spread of online encryption technology. Once the province of governments and major corporations, strong encryption is now as ubiquitous as apps on cellphones.\n\nEven so, the Crypto operation is relevant to modern espionage. Its reach and duration help to explain how the United States developed an insatiable appetite for global surveillance that was [exposed in 2013 by Edward Snowden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/edward-snowden-after-months-of-nsa-revelations-says-his-missions-accomplished/2013/12/23/49fc36de-6c1c-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html). There are also echoes of Crypto in the suspicions swirling around modern companies with alleged links to foreign governments, including the [Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-ban-use-of-kaspersky-software-in-federal-agencies-amid-concerns-of-russian-espionage/2017/09/13/36b717d0-989e-11e7-82e4-f1076f6d6152_story.html), a texting app tied to the [United Arab Emirates](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/us/politics/totok-app-uae.html) and the [Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/leaked-documents-reveal-huaweis-secret-operations-to-build-north-koreas-wireless-network/2019/07/22/583430fe-8d12-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html).\n\nThis story is based on the CIA history and a parallel BND account, also obtained by The Post and ZDF, and interviews with current and former Western intelligence officials as well as Crypto employees. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject.\n\nIt is hard to overstate how extraordinary the CIA and BND histories are. Sensitive intelligence files are periodically declassified and released to the public. But it is exceedingly rare, if not unprecedented, to glimpse authoritative internal histories of an entire covert operation. The Post was able to read all of the documents, but the source of the material insisted that only excerpts be published.\n\nClick any underlined text in the story to see an excerpt from the CIA history.\n\nThe CIA and the BND declined to comment, though U.S. and German officials did not dispute the authenticity of the documents. The first is a 96-page account of the operation completed in 2004 by the CIA\u2019s Center for the Study of Intelligence, an internal historical branch. The second is an oral history compiled by German intelligence officials in 2008.\n\nThe overlapping accounts expose frictions between the two partners over money, control and ethical limits, with the West Germans frequently aghast at the enthusiasm with which U.S. spies often targeted allies.\n\nBut both sides describe the operation as successful beyond their wildest projections. At times, including in the 1980s, Crypto accounted for roughly 40 percent of the diplomatic cables and other transmissions by foreign governments that cryptanalysts at the NSA decoded and mined for intelligence, according to the documents.\n\nAll the while, Crypto generated millions of dollars in profits that the CIA and BND split and plowed into other operations.", "created_utc": 1581520084, "complete": true, "id": "fhedmb0", "link_id": "t3_f2igmb"}, {"parent_id": "t3_p63at", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author": "WolfOnHigh", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Corona Guy here; as a stupid child, I once hit a hornet's nest with a stick from a distance of right the fuck on top of it, which, in case anyone wants to know, is too fucking close.

A senior disease control official blamed layers of bureaucracy. A top government expert blamed the public: The people, he said, simply didn\u2019t understand what he told them.\n\nAs China grapples with a mysterious coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 420 people and sickened thousands, the country\u2019s 1.4 billion people are asking what went wrong. Senior officials are engaging in an unusually blunt display of finger pointing.\n\nSo many officials have denied responsibility that some online users joke that they are watching a passing-the-buck competition. (It\u2019s \u201ctossing the wok\u201d in Chinese.)\n\nThe Chinese people are getting a rare glimpse of how China\u2019s giant, opaque bureaucratic system works \u2014 or, rather, how it fails to work. Too many of its officials have become political apparatchiks, fearful of making decisions that anger their superiors and too removed and haughty when dealing with the public to admit mistakes and learn from them.\n\n\u201cThe most important issue this outbreak exposed is the local government\u2019s lack of action and fear of action,\u201d said Xu Kaizhen, a best-selling author who is famous for his novels that explore the intricate workings of China\u2019s bureaucratic politics.\n\n\u201cUnder the high-pressure environment of anti-corruption campaign, most people, including senior government officials, only care about self-preservation,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the first to speak up. They wait for their superiors to make decisions and are only accountable to their superiors instead of the people.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government appears to be aware of the problem. The Communist Party\u2019s top leadership acknowledged in a meeting on Monday that the epidemic is \u201ca major test of China\u2019s system and capacity for governance.\"\n\nGrowing numbers of people are questioning the government\u2019s decisions as China enters a period of virtual shutdown. As the virus spread, officials in Wuhan and around the country withheld critical information, downplayed the threat and rebuked doctors who tried to raise the alarm. A reconstruction of the diseases\u2019s spread by The New York Times showed that by not issuing earlier warnings, the Chinese government potentially lost the window to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic.\n\nThe outbreak has undermined the myth that the Chinese political elites win assignments and promotion purely on merit. China has sold this system as its own unique innovation. Developing countries have sent thousands of their government officials to China to learn its model of governance, a political system that offers security and growth in return for submission to authoritarian rule.\n\nPeople in China are now questioning that premise. They are focusing much of their anger on Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader and the person many blame for creating a culture of fear and subservience within the Chinese government.\n\nFew people dare to question Mr. Xi openly, for fear of provoking censors or the police. But after Mr. Xi disappeared from public in recent days, some social media users began asking euphemistically, \u201cWhere is that person?\u201d They are also posting online and sharing pictures of former leaders at the site of past crises.\n\nCritics say quietly that, under Mr. Xi, the party began promoting loyal political cadres over technocrats \u2014 the experts and skilled administrators who comprised the backbone of China\u2019s bureaucracy in 1990s and 2000s, when the country grew the fastest.\n\nThose officials could often be corrupt, but even the party\u2019s fiercest critics sometimes acknowledged that they got things done. Liu Zhijun, the former railway minister, is serving a lifetime sentence for taking bribes and abusing power. He also oversaw the creation of China\u2019s high speed rail system, which vastly improved life in the country.\n\nThe wok tossing in China stems in part from the tension between the technocrats, who hold a large number of positions with China\u2019s provincial and national disease control centers, and the political cadres \u2014 the mayors, governors and the provincial party secretaries. The outbreak and lack of disclosure suggests the political cadres are winning. In fact, even the technocrats are becoming cadres because none of them had the courage to tell the public what they knew about the virus.\n\nChinese officials are spending as much as one third of their time on political studying sessions, a lot of which are about Mr. Xi\u2019s speeches. Political loyalty weighs much more in performance evaluations than before. Now the rule of thumb in Chinese officialdom seems to be demonstrating loyalty as explicitly as possible, keeping everything else vague and evading responsibility at all costs when things go wrong.\n\nThe Chinese people may be paying the price. The failures span the system.\n\n\nZhou Xianwang, Wuhan\u2019s mayor, said he didn\u2019t disclose the scale and danger of the epidemic earlier because he needed the authorization from higher up. But he could have done something without sharing much information, including telling the residents to wear masks, wash hands frequently and stop big gatherings such as the potluck banquet attended by over 40,000 families just a few days before his city of 11 million was locked down.\n\nWhen information began to dribble out, it was vague and misleading. In a series of online notices issued between Dec. 31 and Jan. 17, local officials disclosed they were treating pneumonia patients but didn't say when or how many.\n\nThe National Health Commission, the ministry with the authority to declare an epidemic emergency, didn\u2019t issue its own notice about the outbreak until Jan. 19. But the notice essentially kicked blame back to the local authorities. The first sentence cited a rule that required the commission to work with local officials on epidemic prevention.\n\nA top government health adviser, Wang Guangfa, who had reassured the public that the disease was controllable only to be sickened himself, said in an interview after he recovered that he had limited information at the time. He also defended his phrasing as a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d by the general public, saying most outbreaks of infectious diseases are controlled in the end.\n\nLocal officials don\u2019t seem to have local people at the top of their list of priorities. In an interview with state television, Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party secretary of Wuhan, acknowledged that Wuhan residents \u201care a little anxious and a little nervous\u201d and said that he would mobilize all party cells to comfort them. \u201cBut the most important comfort,\u201d he added, \u201ccame from Party Secretary Xi Jinping.\u201d\n\nMr. Xu, the novelist, said Mr. Ma\u2019s remarks demonstrated how officials have more concern for pleasing their bosses than taking care of the people they allegedly serve.\n\n\u201cIf they can rearrange the order in their hearts,\" Mr. Xu said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see a very different governance style.\u201d\n\nAs they try to contain the spread, local governments are showing that they are better at looking busy than they are at finding a solution. Many are now finding ways to track down and even expel residents from Hubei Province to keep the coronavirus from spreading. Tracking potential spreaders is sound policy, but punishing or persecuting them risks driving them underground, making it even harder to fight the outbreak.\n\nEven outside the hardest hit areas, local officials are showing they don\u2019t make rules with the well-being of the people in mind. A video that went viral across China showed a couple stuck on a bridge connecting Guizhou Province to the city of Chongqing. The two governments had halted travel between them, and the couple \u2014 she from Guizhou, he from Chongqing \u2014 had no place to go.\n\nOn social media, low-level cadres are complaining that they are receiving so many instructions from the higher-ups that they spend most of their time filling out spreadsheets instead of getting real work done. In a social media post headlined, \u201cThe Formalism Under the Mask,\u201d the author wrote, \u201cMost people in the system don\u2019t do things to solve problems. They do things to solve responsibilities.\u201d\n\nAfter the epidemic, the Chinese leadership will have to punish a few officials, even severely, to save face and win back some credibility. But for people who are suffering from the epidemic and the failure of governance, the Communist Party may have a hard time winning them back.\n\n\u201cI know before long this country will go back to being a peaceful, prosperous society. We will hear many people screaming how proud they are of its prosperity and power,\u201d a Wuhan resident wrote on the social media site Weibo. \u201cBut after what I have witnessed, I refuse to watch the applause and commendation.\u201d", "created_utc": 1580838988, "complete": true, "id": "fgj8dlu", "link_id": "t3_eytwkr"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fgichrs", "subreddit": "argentina", "author": "empleadoEstatalBot", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "&gt; [[Image](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/9mBATXWRxKXrc1jBboOI8MQPmHw=/999x561/filters:quality(100\\)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NBPGCARI7VDBBB4SF3U3RE6BTU.jpg)](https://www.infobae.com/salud/ciencia/2020/02/03/100-segundos-para-el-apocalipsis-por-que-cientificos-advierten-que-el-cambio-climatico-puede-llevar-a-la-humanidad-al-fin-de-los-tiempos/)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  [](https://www.infobae.com/category/)### [](https://www.infobae.com/category/)[**\u00daLTIMAS NOTICIAS**](http://www.infobae.com/ultimas-noticias)\n&gt; \n&gt;  [[(Gustavo Gavotti)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/KtWmNTXu5r6PGz-KonMXSscaTQ4=/600x400/filters:quality(100\\)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/COQRHC3BRNDF3NDAKITCZBP4VY.jpg)](https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/02/04/murio-el-juez-federal-claudio-bonadio/)#### [Muri\u00f3 el juez federal Claudio Bonadio](https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/02/04/murio-el-juez-federal-claudio-bonadio/)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; #### [Tres accidentes en muy poco tiempo volvieron a encender el debate sobre los micros de dos pisos: \u00bfson seguros?](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2020/02/04/tres-accidentes-en-muy-poco-tiempo-volvieron-a-encender-el-debate-sobre-los-micros-de-dos-pisos-son-seguros/)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; #### [Tras la foto de fin de a\u00f1o para eludir Bienes Personales, volvi\u00f3 el goteo de dep\u00f3sitos en d\u00f3lares](https://www.infobae.com/economia/2020/02/04/tras-la-foto-de-fin-de-ano-para-eludir-bienes-personales-volvio-el-goteo-de-depositos-en-dolares/)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; #### [\u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde nos podemos encontrar?\": los riesgos de los padres que se hacen pasar por sus hijos para atrapar a ped\u00f3filos de las redes](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2020/02/04/donde-nos-podemos-encontrar-los-riesgos-de-los-padres-que-se-hacen-pasar-por-sus-hijos-para-atrapar-a-pedofilos-de-las-redes/)\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  [](https://www.infobae.com/category/)### [](https://www.infobae.com/category/)[[Image](https://www.infobae.com/resizer/?op=resize&amp;url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-wordpress-client-uploads/infobae-wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/27141508/america.png&amp;mode=crop&amp;h=24&amp;q=75&amp;token=bar)](https://www.infobae.com/america/)\n&gt; \n&gt;  [[Foto de archivo.

Is that too stark? Does it offend delicate sensibilities? Would you say that a drug gang who shoots up a bar and kills ten innocent bystanders is just carrying out \u2018typical business practices in their field of endeavor\u2019, and should therefore never be prosecuted in a court of law on a charge of homicide?\u201d (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)\n\n\u2014This article assembles facts contained in my ongoing series on the \u201cChina epidemic.\u201d To get the details, I recommend going back and reading all those articles (archive here).\n\nIf a group wants to stage a fake and frightening epidemic, how would they do it?\n\nFirst of all, what reasons would they have to launch such an audacious plan?\n\nOn one level, they want to cover up human harm that is already occurring. They want to explain this harm with a false story. For example, suppose a combination of deadly corporate air and water and 5G* electronic pollution is making people sick and killing them. The parties responsible are surely not going to admit their crimes. No. Instead, they\u2019re going to claim a new virus is causing this harm in the form of, say, lung disease. The virus just \u201cemerged.\u201d \u201cIt showed up out of nowhere. It crossed species from animals to humans.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026the first thing needed is a cluster of cases in one locale. A small group of people who have the same symptoms. This is easy to find. How about ordinary flu symptoms? Fever, fatigue, weakness, with an emphasis on lung complications [from the forms of pollution]. A few of these people are very ill. Two of them die. Now, the publicity/news machine swings into gear.\n\nIt\u2019s called an \u201coutbreak.\u201d It isn\u2019t, but that\u2019s the story. \u201cThey were all \u2018exposed to something\u2019\u201d at, say, a riverfront dock restaurant.\n\nThe news\u2014shoveled directly into mainstream outlets\u2014comes from elite public health agencies like the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIt\u2019s an OUTBREAK.\n\nTo use a technical term, this is all BULLSHIT. Understand? People in the locale of the \u201cnew case cluster\u201d are falling ill and dying as a result of the actual pollution-causes I listed above. But the news takes a different slant: \u201cResearchers from WHO and CDC state that a \u2018mystery illness\u2019 has emerged in City X, and they are working to discover the virus\u2026\u201d\n\nWho said it was a virus? Who made that unwarranted assumption? WHO and CDC. They always say it\u2019s a virus.\n\nAt this point, suddenly, it\u2019s news all over the planet, and most of the population is roped in, right from the get-go. Virus. Yes. I see. Which virus?\n\nAnd shortly and miraculously, the answer comes: it\u2019s VX-20. A new virus, never seen before, \u201cwhich probably emerged from fish and crossed over into humans. One fisherman has already died.\u201d\n\nVoila. We have a new disease. VX-20.\n\nNext question: did researchers actually find this virus? Did they?\n\nFollow the next piece closely. There is sleight-of-hand involved.\n\nOne scenario: Researchers used what are called \u201cindirect markers\u201d to INFER that a new virus was there, in samples of tissue taken from several people in the original \u201ccluster\u201d of riverfront victims.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t actually use basic procedures to purify the tissue sample from even one patient, and they didn\u2019t see MANY identical viruses in an electron microscope photograph of the purified sample\u2014if they took such a photograph at all. They certainly didn\u2019t perform this complete test on several hundred emerging patients\u2014they should have, but they didn\u2019t. And most certainly, other researchers, including INDEPENDENT analysts, didn\u2019t perform the necessary electron microscope test on hundreds of so-called \u201cepidemic patients.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026the CDC and WHO researchers came up with a notion, an idea, an inference about a virus, through these indirect markers. And via a process of continuing inferences, they characterized the virus they never saw.\n\nScenario two: Let\u2019s be generous and assume the researchers did bother to look at electron microscope photos, derived from only a few patients, not hundreds of patients, as they should have. What did they actually see in the photos? Maybe they saw a few particles that looked similar to each other, BUT quite possibly these virus-like particles were just passengers that ordinarily live in the body and cause no harm. However, the researchers jump up and down and say, THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE NEW KILLING VIRUS. AND WE WILL NOW ASSEMBLE ITS GENETIC SEQUENCE.\n\nAND THEY DO.\n\nSo what? These researchers don\u2019t bother to make the distinction between viruses that might do harm and those that do nothing. Why? Because they\u2019re determined to find something. Anything. That\u2019s their basic mission.\n\nIn both scenarios, they\u2019ve fallen woefully short of proving that a new virus is responsible for making people ill.\n\nBut never mind\u2014news outlets and governments are already on the march. THIS IS IT. A new epidemic. VX-20. A whole city is already locked down. Screeners are waving wands at passengers getting off planes. Some US talking head is saying there is now a rush to develop a vaccine. New cases of VX-20 are showing up in other cities and other countries. Boom.\n\nLet\u2019s examine that last part, about new cases and \u201cspreading\u201d\u2014 because this is where people REALLY fall for the con. They say: \u201cWell, here is a city where there is no air or water or 5G pollution, and they\u2019re discovering new cases, so how do you explain that?\u201d\n\nThe new cases and the spread are based entirely on DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. Those test-results determine whether there is an \u201cepidemic case\u201d or a \u201cspread.\u201d", "created_utc": 1582817448, "complete": true, "id": "fixc7ck", "link_id": "t3_fadnjh"}, {"parent_id": "t3_fh57wi", "subreddit": "nCoV", "author": "IIWIIM8", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": true, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": true, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": true, "anticipation": true, "joy": true}, "body": "^***Translation:***\n\n**Coronavirus, Conte: \"In Italy all shops except food and pharmacies closed until March 25th.

The premier, Giuseppe Conte , speaks live on Facebook - at 9:45 pm - in a speech with even dramatic features. \"Thanks to the Italians who make sacrifices. We are proving to be a great nation,\" he begins. Then he lists the new measures, saying: \"In the first place there is the health of the Italians\". Then he explains: \"All shops will be closed except those for basic necessities, such as pharmacies and food. Home delivery is allowed.\" The activities of bars, pubs and restaurants are therefore suspended (all day and not only after 6 pm). Hairdressers, beauty centers and canteen services close. While newsagents and tobacconists will be open, and plumbers, mechanics and petrol stations will also work.\n\nIndustries will remain open but with \"security measures\", that is, provided they guarantee initiatives to avoid contagion. On the other hand, the \"non-essential\" production departments were closed. The regulation of work shifts and early holidays is also encouraged.\n\n\"Transport, agricultural activities, banking, insurance and postal services will be guaranteed\". The premier also announces the appointment of a commissioner for intensive care with \"broad powers\": Domenico Arcuri, the man currently driving Invitalia. The speech ends with a message-appeal: \"Let's stay away today to embrace tomorrow\".\n\nPositive reactions from the opposition, starting with Matteo Salvini (\"As an Italian I am satisfied, the government listened to the cry for help from doctors, nurses, workers, entrepreneurs, mayors and governors) and Giorgia Meloni (\" Receive our proposals \"). Antonio Tajani of Forza Italia is also satisfied.\n\nPrior to Conte's direct intervention, the number two of the Democratic Party, Andrea Orlando , also spoke: \"The government will take all the further measures necessary to deal with the contagion on the basis of the indications of the technical-scientific bodies and the comparison with the regions. we have always repeated in these hours we will support them with determination \". And Matteo Renzi , leader of Italia Viva: \"Well the grip, now let's think about liquidity for families and businesses\". And Luigi Di Maio , who posts the tricolor on social media: \"We will make it. Italy will make it\".\n\nThe government found a summary after a day of meetings. A day marked by the pressing of many regions, starting from Lombardy and the governor Attilio Fontana , in the name of the appeal: \"Close everything\". Concerns had instead come from Confindustria Lombardia. But at the end of the evening he comments: \"Conte's decisions deserve respect and gratitude.

I refuted it and offered evidence from the congressional record that directly contradicts your claim.\n\nInstead of asking for that evidence and reviewing it, you instead jumped into this absurd (paraphrasing) \"voters have this opinion which stands in contradiction to the facts, therefore those facts are opinion\" nonsense.\n\n&gt;Your mistake is some sort of strange belief that when people say \"Sanders doesn't compromise or act pragmatically\" that they mean it in the absolute. As if he is physically incapable of it, or that he has never in his life done so.\n\nThe statement is typically made in the absolute but I never take it that way because I know most people recognize he can, they just typically think its the exception rather than the rule. That holds true for the vast majority of people I've spoken with.\n\n&gt;So your presentation of some select instances of it does not make that opinion somehow wrong.\n\nI select a couple of instances that show different approaches and provide the information necessary for the individual to do further research on their own if they wish to be actually informed.\n\nI do it this way because the congressional record is EXTENSIVE and it takes effort. It's not my job, nor do I have the time, to trace every single instance ever for every single thing Sanders has done across nearly 30 years in federal office.\n\nAll I can do is point people to the information. They have to be willing to do a little work on their own too. I realize it's asking a lot. Horse and water and all that.\n\n&gt;I can recognize that Sanders has compromised and acted with some degree of pragmatism, and still believe that he is bad at it, and unwilling to do so generally.\n\nAnd yet, when offered evidence concerning this opinion, rather than entertain it, you simply dismiss it out of hand as insufficient without putting forth a single iota of effort.\n\nYou've literally spent more energy writing these posts trying to diminish evidence you haven't even considered to the same level of opinion as your own conclusion which would be directly contradicted by said evidence.", "created_utc": 1584176175, "complete": true, "id": "fkgvdr8", "link_id": "t3_ficma8"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fjgd1ye", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "The-Rim-Tickler", "emotion": {"disgust": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": true, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": true, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Britain is not a big island, and the UK is not just Britain.

Let's assume it takes 3 weeks to go from being infected, to dead in a hospital.\n\nLet's assume all the deaths happened today. It's inaccurate, I know, the deaths were spread out, but if we assume this it's actually a better case scenario, because if you spread it out over time then the virus has even more time to spread.\n\nSo, 153 deaths. 1% mortality rate and 3 weeks infection to death, means that 3 weeks ago there were 15,300 infected people. In 3 weeks, that's 21 days, and assuming a 5-day doubling period, that's 4 doublings, so a 16-fold increase. There would be about 244,800 cases now. Of those 244,800 infected (according to this math), that means that 3 weeks from now, we will have 2,448 additional deaths. There's also a 5% hospitalization rate, so in 3 weeks we'll also have 12,240 hospitalizations.\n\nIf it was a 3-day doubling period, then we would have had 7 doublings, a 128-fold increase. There would be about 1,958,400 infected nowadays, which we could round to 2 million. Of those 2 million currently infected today, 20,000 will be dead in 3 weeks, and 100,000 will need to be hospitalized.\n\nIf we do social distancing, shelter in place, and quarantine measures in order to flatten the curve, we will see the results in 3 weeks. For the next 3 weeks, cases will continue to grow, people will continue to go to the hospitals, and people will continue to die. We will see, at minimum, between 12,000 to 50,000 people who will need to be hospitalized, and between 2,500 to 10,000 deaths.\n\nThis is taking into account all the deaths as though they all happened at the same time, and is only considering the number of people who are infected from those original 153 deaths. It doesn't even take into account all the people who are currently infected and currently spreading the disease.\n\nSo yeah. Buckle up, things are about to get a lot worse before they get better.\n\nEDIT: updated numbers from [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) at 8:50 PM 2020-03-19, 214 deaths.\n\n21,400 infected, for the 5-day doubling 16-fold increase, we get 24,2400 infected in 3 weeks, and 3,424 deaths and 17,120 hospitalizations. \n\nFor the 3-day doubling 128-fold increase, we have 2,739,200 infected in 3 weeks, and 27,392 dead and 136,960 hospitalizations.\n\nBuckle up people.", "created_utc": 1584665395, "complete": true, "id": "fkz8u35", "link_id": "t3_flbl7s"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fi40d11", "subreddit": "China_Flu", "author": "taosbob", "emotion": {"disgust": true, "trust": true, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": true, "love": false, "surprise": true, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Many things are still unclear, I grant you. \n\nFor example, Bloomberg is currently surging in the polls.

For me, this will be about making money, I'll have to shed my political bias.\n\n**Russia**\n\nThe first bit of reading I plan to do over the weekend is to establish a decent grasp of Russian and Saudi government systems. It shouldn't be too hard for Russia, as I've been slightly keeping up with what's been going on there ever since the conflict in Ukraine, Saudi Arabia will be a whole different story. My goal will be to establish what they can handle oil price wise. From what I can see both Russia and the Saudis are already starting to bleed. From the looks of it, one of them is going to start capitulating by the end of the month. I believe the Saudis will emerge victorious in all of this, but I still have way way more reading. \n\n**America**\n\nGiven Reddit is blinded by partisanship, I'll state an obvious belief that I have. The Trump administration is extremely weak with a strong following. In every bit of conflict they pretty much capitulate. A loose framework how Trump works is say the most extreme thing to bring the other party to the negotiating table, and then find just enough to show his political base that he is successful. This admin is willing to subsidize farmers to take the losses of weak negotiating tactics, I'm more than willing to bet that it will subsidize oil companies to establish some form of confidence in the markets. From what I can see with the virus, Pelosi and Trumps crews look pretty united. \n\nThe Fed looks like it is willing to kick into high gear to do what it needs to do right now:\n\n&gt;[Fed to pump in more than $1 trillion in dramatic ramping up of market intervention amid coronavirus meltdown\n](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/fed-to-pump-more-than-500-billion-into-short-term-bank-funding-expand-types-of-security-purchases.html)\n\nMy best bet too is that if this continues on long enough Trump will use this as an opportunity to push the Fed into negative interest rates; something he's been pushing for a long time.\n\nIf there is impacts due to the virus, I'll bet there will be some form of package agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats that will provide immediate funding to vaccines or a stimulus package to any market segments that need it. Given how successful Hank Paulson's bailouts were, even though highly controversial, I think the Americans will use the same framework to try and provide confidence in the markets.\n\n**EU &amp;&amp; China**\n\nI have reading to do. I'm going to talk to a friend of mine that is a virus researcher, get him to send me a few people that will give me comprehensive breakdowns of what's going on. I'll try and build a conclusion what exactly is going on in Europe and Asia. There's a whole lot I'll be looking at for this. Too much to list. However, I'm going to spend a lot of my focus on the oil wars, as I think that has more to do with markets taking a shit than anything else.\n \n**Canada**\n\nAs I said, I'll be investing in Canada. Probably financials, and maybe energy. The Canadian government is obligated to bail out banks if anything falls, so I'm pretty safe guarded. The BoC generally tends to follow the Americans lead on rate cuts. \n\nCanada has already been announcing major investments into virus protection. The federal government (Liberal) said 1 billion (it's a lot for us guys) and the Ontario government (Conservative) said 100 million. Also as I said in another thread the Canadian Federal and Provincial governments are pretty unified so much so that Jason Kenney is on his way to Ottawa to figure out what to do about oil. It seems like there is some want to to work with the Federal government (This is a big thing for anyone that knows the workings of Canadian politics). \n\nThe Federal Liberals are no stranger to bail outs. Given that most of this will have to do with bail outs in Conservative ridings (AB), they'll probably have the support of the Conservatives in the house for any stimulus that could bring confidence back to Canadian markets. This Liberal Government will even go as far to nationalize a pipeline to try and get shit done faster. \n\nSo I think where I'm willing to put money, I'll probably do okay. I'll also have two MBA's watching my ass and consulting me about the small things I need to know in companies I'll be investing in. \n\nAll of this logic might have holes in it. Holes I'm frankly not willing to write a book about on Reddit. I don't give a shit about partisan politics or anything. There's a lot I'll be able to know from what I've already read about. Regardless, I'm not going to die if I lose this money, and I don't believe the sky is falling. \n\nJapan and Thailand look like they're taking a shit.We'll se how I do.", "created_utc": 1584083956, "complete": true, "id": "fkdlrmj", "link_id": "t3_fhp40c"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fknb9q9", "subreddit": "australia", "author": "mainly_lurk", "emotion": {"disgust": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": true, "sadness": false, "pessimism": true, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": true, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Firstly we're running low on testing kits.

Let's pretend we have infinity COVID-19 testing kits and they're free. Let's pretend you're the Australian Federal Minister for Health. Your decision is to \"test everybody\" but what's your plan?\n\nLet's suppose you get tested now, and return a negative result. That doesn't mean you won't catch COVID-19 tomorrow. It's actually not even a guarantee that you haven't been exposed to coronavirus already but you're yet to start shedding virus. So ... how often do you want to test everyone? Once a day? Once a week? Maybe after each person has done their swab they just return to the end of the queue be tested again when they reach the front?\n\nMaybe your plan is to swab everyone today, find everyone who is positive for the virus, isolate them at home and BOOM problem solved. This is a reasonable plan, BUT, the fact is that, rightly or wrongly, Australia made a decision NOT to take this approach. And, if we're not going to enforce strict isolation, then mass testing is a waste of time.\n\nA couple of weeks ago the number of cases in Australia was minuscule. We knew the location of every case in the country. We COULD have isolated all of those cases, and a couple of hundred of people close to them, prevented anyone else bringing it into Australia and it would have eradicated the virus from Australia. Somebody decided we weren't going to do this. We weren't going to try to eradicate it - just try to keep it spreading slowly.\n\nSo, if we are not going to enforce strict isolation policies in an attempt to eradicate the virus then there is NO POINT testing everybody. The results of those tests won't change anything. We're still going to advise people to stay home if they are sick, cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze, avoid unnecessary contact with others (shaking hands, kissing etc), avoid large gatherings where one person could spread it to 1,000.\n\nThis virus will continue to spread. Get used to hearing about how many new cases we've had each day. There is zero intent to stop these new cases. However, the hope is that the spread will be slow - rather than being passed from one person to 10,000. If we do get a mass outbreak our strategy will change to a complete lock-down of everybody until the health system catches up. Just like Italy and China were forced to do.\n\nI know what you're thinking ... \"How will we know whether we have a mass outbreak unless we're testing everybody?\" We will know because our ICU beds will start filling up with very sick people - all of whom test positive for COVID-19 - because we were able to test them because we didn't waste our limited test kits testing everybody.", "created_utc": 1584410574, "complete": true, "id": "fkphxvw", "link_id": "t3_fjcjdk"}, {"parent_id": "t3_r1mkg", "subreddit": "atheism", "author": "drphillcollins", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Hi man, strange to find this this exact night.

The numbers may rise again as China\u2019s economy begins to revive. But for now, far more new cases are appearing elsewhere in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; China\u2019s counterattack can be replicated, Dr. Aylward said, but it will require speed, money, imagination and political courage.\n&gt; \n&gt; For countries that act quickly, containment is still possible \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have a global pandemic \u2014 we have outbreaks occurring globally,\u201d he added.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dr. Aylward, who has 30 years experience in fighting polio, Ebola and other global health emergencies, detailed in an interview with The New York Times how he thinks the campaign against the virus should be run.\n&gt; \n&gt; This conversation has been edited and condensed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do we know what this virus\u2019s lethality is? We hear some estimates that it\u2019s close to the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed 2.5 percent of its victims, and others that it\u2019s a little worse than the seasonal flu, which kills only 0.1 percent. How many cases are missed affects that.\n&gt; \n&gt; There\u2019s this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases. Many people are asymptomatic when tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Guangdong, they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province. (Covid-19 is the medical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.)\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no evidence that we\u2019re seeing only the tip of a grand iceberg, with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus. What we\u2019re seeing is a pyramid: most of it is aboveground.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I\u2019ll be saying, \u201cGuess what? Those data didn\u2019t tell us the story.\u201d But the data we have now don\u2019t support it.\n&gt; \n&gt; That\u2019s good, if there\u2019s little asymptomatic transmission. But it\u2019s bad in that it implies that the death rates we\u2019ve seen \u2014 from 0.7 percent in parts of China to 5.8 percent in Wuhan \u2014 are correct, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019ve heard it said that \u201cthe mortality rate is not so bad because there are actually way more mild cases.\u201d Sorry \u2014 the same number of people that were dying, still die. The real case fatality rate is probably what it is outside Hubei Province, somewhere between 1 and 2 percent.\n&gt; What about children? We know they are rarely hospitalized. But do they get infected? Do they infect their families?\n&gt; \n&gt; We don\u2019t know. That Guangdong survey also turned up almost no one under 20. Kids got flu, but not this. We have to do more studies to see if they get it and aren\u2019t affected, and if they pass it to family members. But I asked dozens of doctors: Have you seen a chain of transmission where a child was the index case? The answer was no.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Why? There\u2019s a theory that youngsters get the four known mild coronaviruses so often that they\u2019re protected.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That\u2019s still a theory. I couldn\u2019t get enough people to agree to put it in the W.H.O. report.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Does that imply that closing schools is pointless?**\n&gt; \n&gt; No. That\u2019s still a question mark. If a disease is dangerous, and you see clusters, you have to close schools. We know that causes problems, because as soon as you send kids home, half your work force has to stay home to take care of them. But you don\u2019t take chances with children.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Are the cases in China really going down?**\n&gt; \n&gt; I know there\u2019s suspicion, but at every testing clinic we went to, people would say, \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was three weeks ago.\u201d It peaked at 46,000 people asking for tests a day; when we left, it was 13,000. Hospitals had empty beds.\n&gt; \n&gt; I didn\u2019t see anything that suggested manipulation of numbers. A rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued, and come down faster than would have been expected. Back of the envelope, it\u2019s hundreds of thousands of people in China that did not get Covid-19 because of this aggressive response.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Is the virus infecting almost everyone, as you would expect a novel flu to?**\n&gt; \n&gt; No \u2014 75 to 80 percent of all clusters are in families. You get the odd ones in hospitals or restaurants or prisons, but the vast majority are in families. And only 5 to 15 percent of your close contacts develop disease. So they try to isolate you from your relatives as quickly as possible, and find everyone you had contact with in 48 hours before that.\n&gt; \n&gt; **You said different cities responded differently. How?**\n&gt; \n&gt; It depended on whether they had zero cases, sporadic ones, clusters or widespread transmission.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, you have to make sure everyone knows the basics: hand-washing, masks, not shaking hands, what the symptoms are. Then, to find sporadic cases, they do fever checks everywhere, even stopping cars on highways to check everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soon as you find clusters, you shut schools, theaters, restaurants. Only Wuhan and the cities near it went into total lockdown.\n&gt; \n&gt; **How did the Chinese reorganize their medical response?**\n&gt; \n&gt; First, they moved 50 percent of all medical care online so people didn\u2019t come in. Have you ever tried to reach your doctor on Friday night? Instead, you contacted one online. If you needed prescriptions like insulin or heart medications, they could prescribe and deliver it.\n&gt; \n&gt; **But if you thought you had coronavirus?**\n&gt; \n&gt; You would be sent to a fever clinic. They would take your temperature, your symptoms, medical history, ask where you\u2019d traveled, your contact with anyone infected. They\u2019d whip you through a CT scan \u2026\n&gt; \n&gt; **Wait \u2014 \u201cwhip you through a CT scan\u201d?**\n&gt; \n&gt; Each machine did maybe 200 a day. Five, 10 minutes a scan. Maybe even partial scans. A typical hospital in the West does one or two an hour. And not X-rays; they could come up normal, but a CT would show the \u201cground-glass opacities\u201d they were looking for.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Dr. Aylward was referring to lung abnormalities seen in coronavirus patients.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **And then?**\n&gt; \n&gt; If you were still a suspect case, you\u2019d get swabbed. But a lot would be told, \u201cYou\u2019re not Covid.\u201d People would come in with colds, flu, runny noses. That\u2019s not Covid. If you look at the symptoms, 90 percent have fever, 70 percent have dry coughs, 30 percent have malaise, trouble breathing. Runny noses were only 4 percent.\n&gt; \n&gt; The swab was for a PCR test, right? How fast could they do that? Until recently, we were sending all of ours to Atlanta.\n&gt; \n&gt; They got it down to four hours.\n&gt; \n&gt; **So people weren\u2019t sent home?**\n&gt; \n&gt; No, they had to wait. You don\u2019t want someone wandering around spreading virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; **If they were positive, what happened?**\n&gt; \n&gt; They\u2019d be isolated. In Wuhan, in the beginning, it was 15 days from getting sick to hospitalization. They got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation. That meant a lot fewer infected \u2014 you choke off this thing\u2019s ability to find susceptibles.\n&gt; \n&gt; **What\u2019s the difference between isolation and hospitalization?**\n&gt; \n&gt; With mild symptoms, you go to an isolation center. They were set up in gymnasiums, stadiums \u2014 up to 1,000 beds. But if you were severe or critical, you\u2019d go straight to hospitals. Anyone with other illnesses or over age 65 would also go straight to hospitals.\n&gt; \n&gt; What were mild, severe and critical? We think of \u201cmild\u201d as like a minor cold.\n&gt; \n&gt; No. \u201cMild\u201d was a positive test, fever, cough \u2014 maybe even pneumonia, but not needing oxygen. \u201cSevere\u201d was breathing rate up and oxygen saturation down, so needing oxygen or a ventilator. \u201cCritical\u201d was respiratory failure or multi-organ failure.\n&gt; \n&gt; So saying 80 percent of all cases are mild doesn\u2019t mean what we thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; I\u2019m Canadian. This is the Wayne Gretzky of viruses \u2014 people didn\u2019t think it was big enough or fast enough to have the impact it does.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Hospitals were also separated?**\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. The best hospitals were designated just for Covid, severe and critical. All elective surgeries were postponed. Patients were moved. Other hospitals were designated just for routine care: women still have to give birth, people still suffer trauma and heart attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; They built two new hospitals, and they rebuilt hospitals. If you had a long ward, they\u2019d build a wall at the end with a window, so it was an isolation ward with \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d zones. You\u2019d go in, gown up, treat patients, and then go out the other way and de-gown. It was like an Ebola treatment unit, but without as much disinfection because it\u2019s not body fluids.\n&gt; \n&gt; **How good were the severe and critical care?**\n&gt; \n&gt; China is really good at keeping people alive. Its hospitals looked better than some I see here in Switzerland. We\u2019d ask, \u201cHow many ventilators do you have?\u201d They\u2019d say \u201c50.\u201d Wow! We\u2019d say, \u201cHow many ECMOs?\u201d They\u2019d say \u201cfive.\u201d The team member from the Robert Koch Institute said, \u201cFive? In Germany, you get three, maybe. And just in Berlin.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; (ECMOs are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, which oxygenate the blood when the lungs fail.)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Who paid for all of this?**\n&gt; \n&gt; The government made it clear: testing is free. And if it was Covid-19, when your insurance ended, the state picked up everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the U.S., that\u2019s a barrier to speed. People think: \u201cIf I see my doctor, it\u2019s going to cost me $100. If I end up in the I.C.U., what\u2019s it going to cost me?\u201d That\u2019ll kill you. That\u2019s what could wreak havoc.

Fallon / For The Times)\n\u201cStaying home is a luxury,\u201d said 44-year-old Sonia Rodriguez, who works six days a week cleaning houses and serving as a caregiver for a senior with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Rodriguez, who recently lost her husband, lives in San Fernando with her four children.\n\nMany of the housekeepers take buses to get to work. They worry this leaves them exposed to the virus, which thrives on close contact. Experts have suggested that people practice social distancing to stay safe. But, like staying home, this too feels like a luxury they can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cIf they quarantine us,\u201d Rodriguez said, \u201cwhere are we going to get money?\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 2.5 million domestic workers across the country. Most don\u2019t have access to healthcare and 83% do not get paid sick days, according to Ai-jen Poo, founder and director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.\n\nOn a call with domestic workers last week, Poo heard from workers worried about losing jobs and not being able to put food on the table. A nanny, for example, said she was fired by employers who said they were doing social distancing and didn\u2019t want anyone coming into their house.\n\nHousekeepers\nHousekeeper Dora Mayen boards a bus after meeting for morning coffee with other housekeepers at a cafe near UCLA before heading out to work in homes in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.(Patrick T. Fallon / For The Times)\n\u201cFrom a wages and income perspective, most domestic workers can\u2019t afford to take a single day off,\u201d Poo said. \u201cWhen you look at the world through the eyes of domestic workers ... you start to see the ways in which the crisis is compounded for low-wage workers.\u201d\n\n\nThe National Domestic Workers Alliance has focused on passing bills of rights for domestic workers, and created a benefits platform that allows employers to contribute to an account that would help workers to get paid time off and insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is such a precarious workforce,\u201d Poo said. \u201cI\u2019ve often described the domestic work industry as the Wild West because there\u2019s such a long history of exclusion from basic rights and protections.\u201d\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread, with more than 2,500 cases in the U.S. as of Saturday afternoon, some organizations are offering advice on how to support caregivers and domestic workers. Hand in Hand, a national network of employers of nannies, house cleaners and home attendants, has released a guide on \u201cHow to be a fair employer during the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nIt urges employers to come up with a plan for what to do in the case of illness and to provide paid sick leave for domestic workers so they can visit the doctor or stay home to care for themselves or family members who might be sick.\n\nFor Carmen Solano, a Brentwood housekeeper, the subject of coronavirus hasn\u2019t come up with her employers. In the fall, Solano was one of a number of housekeepers who showed up to work in a neighborhood that was under mandatory evacuation because of the Getty fire.\n\nSolano, 64, has diabetes and worries about the coronavirus, which is especially dangerous not only to older people but those who have underlying health issues.\n\nSome counties have warned the elderly and people with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic liver disease, blood disorders and other conditions to remain at home as much as possible.\n\nBut Solano needs the money to pay her $900 rent.\n\n\n\u201cI already make so little for rent,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up on the street.\u201d\n\nAt the Westwood cafe, hand sanitizer was a fixture in workers\u2019 bags, tucked beside extra pairs of shoes and lunches. The women slid into booths next to one another or crowded around tables, stashing rain jackets in their bags.\n\n\u201cAhora, las voy a saludar asi,\u201d joked Rodriguez, holding a hand close to her mouth and blowing air kisses at the four women seated at a corner table. (\u201cNow, I will greet you like this.\u201d)\n\nEach time the door opened, the women turned, prepared to greet another friend.\n\nThey\u2019ve known each other for years. Some met as they shared a bus to work on the Westside; others in this cafe near UCLA. Many of them fled El Salvador decades ago, trying to escape a civil war that tore the country apart.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for each other in the good times and the bad,\u201d said 59-year-old Sonia Esperanza Valencia, who has worked as a housekeeper in a Westwood home for over 20 years.\n\nShe watched her employers\u2019 daughters grow up. One of the girls told her that when she got married, she wanted Valencia there. Valencia\u2019s phone is filled with pictures of the now 23-year-old woman, who lives in New York.\n\nValencia counts herself lucky. Her hours have not been cut. But those of her husband, a truck driver, have.\n\nWhile some employers have canceled on workers without paying, others have offered to help as much as they can.\n\nRodriguez has friends who have continued working in homes where people are sick. Another called asking Rodriguez if she could help her find work after one family let her go over a cough.\n\nIf Rodriguez has to stay home, either because she or her employers become ill, two of the five families she works for said they will keep paying her for about a month.\n\n\u201cObviously I won\u2019t be earning the same, but I\u2019ll still have their support,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, I work with good families.\u201d", "created_utc": 1584286036, "complete": true, "id": "fkkkf5b", "link_id": "t3_fj1ffm"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fkkied9", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "lesmexyfish", "emotion": {"disgust": true, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": true, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": true, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "Let's do the math:\n\nI'm not in Australia, but in the U.S. high schools run on a 9-period schedule with 1 period lunch.

I already posted this at r/WuhanVirus, but since this r/Coronavirus doesn\u2019t allow crosspost, I am posting here too.\n\nWuhan is my hometown, all my family and friends are living there. I can tell you what have happened to them. \n\nSince the entire city shut down in January, my family and my friends have been confined in their apartments for more than 2 months now!  The only people go outside are: my niece (her company gave her full protection gear so she can go to the office once a week; she will encounter almost no one in office either); some of my friends volunteered at the makeshift hospitals, few of them have protection gear, mostly just a disposable ponchos. \n\nEveryone wears masks!  If you are caught going outside without one, you can be arrested. The fact our government told us masks are unnecessary is the most puzzling thing for Chinese people. Because they were told the opposite thing. They have real life evidence why wearing masks is important (an old man with the virus took his mask off in a bus, another old man got it from him sitting next to him); so they have concluded the true reason for saying masks are not necessarily is because there are not enough for every American, so we won\u2019t panic about it. \n\nThe entire city of 11 million without anyone wondering about. No private cars on the road. No school, no movies (in fact, all Chinese blockbusters are made available online for free!), no any kind of gatherings, no visiting, no going to restaurants, no grocery shopping...\n\nI know now you are wondering how do people eat?  Well, China has become a cashless country, everyone pays with WeChat online payment system. What happens is that everyone is part of their neighborhood WeChat group, including the stores. When the stores got a shipment of food, they will announce it in the group, and then everyone will buy what they need via online payment, and then someone will deliver it to your door. No human contacts!  The bags will be disinfected before coming into the apartment. \n\nThe system worked well enough, but my friends are complaining it\u2019s hard to make the usual dishes. Since when beef is available, there is no potatoes, so you can\u2019t make beef potato dish. Everyone is showing off their own recipes with any food available that day. LOL!\n\nI am happy to report that with everyone\u2019s cooperation, none of my friends and family is infected so far!\n\nSocial distancing works! No matter how much you hate it, please keep your distance from others. Wuhan has been doing it for more than 2 months!  We can do our part too.\n\nSorry about the long post, but I want to make one more point: just because you are young and healthy, doesn\u2019t mean you can survive the virus. I know what the statistics says, but there are cases of young people dying all the time!  Including a 2 year old girl, who was the last one to die of her entire family!  First her grandparents, then her parents.  When she finally died, all the doctors and nurses broke down!  Children can die from this virus too!!  There was a famous bodybuilder in Wuhan, who went to the gym despite of the outbreak, died very soon afterwards!  There is also the sad case of the entire department of a hospital dying! \n\nThe US government has messed up!  Refusing the test kits from WHO, not preparing the health systems, lying and downplaying the seriousness of the illness, we have wasted an entire month to get ready!!\n\nThis virus is not a flu!  I\u2019ve read several articles of first hand experiences. 2 of them actually written by 2 healthy young men, they were describing near death ordeals. You know why toilet paper is needed?  Because you actually will have diarrhea, you will also throw up, unable to keep any food in your body for days!  You will not be able to breathe, your body can eventually shut down due to how weak you are. I\u2019ve seen videos of people face planted on the street due to this, including one of the authors of the article. He was waiting in line in hospital for more than 6 hours, finally his body just gave up. After he was revived, he was still sent home because there is not enough hospital beds!!  \n\nI don\u2019t want to cause you to panic, but I do think most people in America haven\u2019t learned the truth yet.

Wow, I just realized how much I miss the The Funhouse, Crocodile, Neumo's and The Triple Door.    \n  \nNot sure if you are aware, but the max cash you can travel with when passing customs is $10,000 (USD) and I believe up to PHP50,000. The exchange rate is better after you get here. Monex places in the US or right at the airport in Manila will not give you a very good exchange rate. The international fees for ATM withdrawals from your Stateside bank account are exorbitant. So, if you need money from the States, plan ahead about how you will do the transfers. Xoom, Transfast and Western Union are good for inexpensive wire transfers. You can send money to yourself this way, or have family or friends back home wire to you. The monies can be remitted at M. Luhulier (they're everywhere, just look up locations online) and the larger banks (Metrobank, BDO - also literally everywhere).  \n  \nDon't be surprised if smaller stores or sari-saris cannot make change for a PhP1,000 or 500 note. It is largely a hand-to-mouth economy, and most transactions are done in cash. Smaller notes and lots of coins will make purchases easier for you. Also, smaller notes, like the PHP20 and 50 are often dirty and smelly. This is because these denominations are exchanged by hard working people in the wet market (meat, fish and poultry) and trike and pedicab drivers. The money will smell and just be gross to the touch. I will wash money sometimes to avoid germs.\n  \nMoney goes a long way here and the exchange rate with the US dollar is pretty good at this time. I recommend avoiding the practice of converting prices to US Dollars to see if something is a good deal or if you feel you can afford it. It is actually easier to learn the buying power of the Peso and relative value of things by thinking in terms of the Peso itself. Take queues from your Filipino co-workers and friends by asking them, \"is this a good deal/price?\" or, \"how much do you pay for ______?\" You'll soon learn how much things should cost so you know when someone is trying to give you the \"Amerikano price.\"  \n  \nPlease be careful about \"lending\" money, or \"sponsoring\" an event such as birthday or baptism. If you don't mind and feel you can afford to just give it away, then that's fine. But it will probably happen at some point; a friend or new stranger you meet while traveling will ask to borrow money. It will be an amount that you're not comfortable giving, or you just don't know the person well enough. There is always a story or emergency, then some sort of remittance that they are expecting so they'll be able to pay you back within a week or two. I've used excuses that I'm on a limited budget or I have an upcoming expense and have to conserve my monies, then assert I'm unable to lend. This softens the blow and you don't want to hurt their feelings by saying you are *unwilling* to lend. Once people learn that they cannot go to you for money, they will stop asking.  \n  \nThe Sinulog Fiesta in Cebu is an amazing experience. Definitely worth the trip, as is Cebu in general. There are fiestas all the time. There are fiestas for religious holidays, barangay or regional anniversaries and so on. Just look online or ask people in your area. There is often singing, dancing, parades and great food at the fiestas. If you like surfing, Surigao is the place to be. If you have a little more cash, Puerto Princesa is an amazing resort destination. The underground river in the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park was declared as one of the new 7 wonders of nature. It really is a magical place and experience. Less expensive resort areas include Dakak and Siquijor. They have beautiful, white sandy beaches and are less touristy.  \n  \nIsland hopping is so easy, and relatively inexpensive here. You can either catch a plane or ferry to visit other destinations. Personally, my favorite local airline is Cebu Pacific. They play great music on the planes and the flight attendants host games with prizes. I don't want to play on the fear mongering, just be sure to have a travel buddy if you are going to the less urbanized provinces. You are at risk of being a mark, especially as a female. That does not mean that thieves will be trailing you constantly. Again, there are far more good and honest people here than bad. Just use common sense, travel with one or more friends, and you won't have any problems.  \n  \nIf you are an animal lover, you will be shocked by the number of stray dogs and cats here. Just a heads-up. Most people cannot afford to keep a pet and the government budget for animal control is nearly non-existent. Strays roam the streets and are often diseased and mangy. It's just not a priority for people to care for animals when they are concerned about putting food on the table.  \n  \nThis is a \"third world\" country. Be prepared for poverty outside of the metro areas, and even pockets and barangays/neighborhoods within the cities. Know that this doesn't mean people are miserable. It would be a mistake to judge them this way. In the less urbanized municipalities, most people are happy and enjoy a simple (yet sometimes hard) life where family and community takes priority. This adjustment has been the best thing to happen to me. I used to be a stressed-out managing partner in a busy technology consulting firm, less than a year ago. Now I live by the sea and have a peaceful life, surrounded by wonderful people.\n  \n", "created_utc": 1393907118, "complete": true, "id": "cftuilx", "link_id": "t3_1zdz7j"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fkcsr3z", "subreddit": "politics", "author": "kingsumo_1", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": true, "fear": true, "optimism": true, "anticipation": true, "joy": false}, "body": "Sure!\n\n&gt;Read President Trump\u2019s Speech on Coronavirus Pandemic: Full Transcript\n\n&gt;Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump announced a suspension of travel from Europe for 30 days, starting on Friday.\n\n--\n\n&gt;My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation\u2019s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.\n\n&gt;Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.\n\n&gt;We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.\n\n&gt;This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.  I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.\n\n&gt;From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats.  This is the way it always was and always will be.  It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.\n\n&gt;Our team is the best anywhere in the world.  At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years.  We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.\n\n&gt;And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. \n\n&gt;The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots.  As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\n\n&gt;After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans.\n\n&gt;To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.  The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.  These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.\n\n&gt;There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval.  Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing.  These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.\n\n&gt;At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea.  And, as their situation improves, we will re-evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.\n\n&gt;Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.\n\n&gt;We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time.  These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.\n\n&gt;Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help C.D.C. and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments and distribution of medical supplies.  Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day.  We are moving very quickly.\n\n&gt;The vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low.  Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus.  The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions.  The elderly population must be very, very careful.\n\n&gt;In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits.  In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas. \n\n&gt;My administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing and reducing large gatherings.\n\n&gt;Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.\n\n&gt;Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts \u2014 and they are the best.\n\n&gt;For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene.  Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus.  Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.\n\n&gt;To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief.  This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.\n\n&gt;I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.\n\n&gt;Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.\n\n&gt;Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong.  Our unemployment is at a historic low.  This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.\n\n&gt;This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.  \n\n&gt;However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions:  I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.\n\n&gt;Effective immediately, the S.B.A. will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories.  These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus.  To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion.\n\n&gt;Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted.  This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.\n\n&gt;Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.  Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.\n\n&gt;We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus.  We made a lifesaving move with early action on China.  Now we must take the same action with Europe.  We will not delay.  I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people.  I will always put the well being of America first.\n\n&gt;If we are vigilant \u2014 and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will \u2014 we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus.  The virus will not have a chance against us.\n\n&gt;No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.  We have the best economy, the most advanced health care, and the most talented doctors, scientists and researchers anywhere in the world.\n\n&gt;We are all in this together.  We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family.\n\n&gt;As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity.\n\n&gt;Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine.  Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.\n\n&gt;God bless you, and God bless America.  Thank you.\n\nThere is a number of lies, gaslighting, unicorn wishes, jingoism, and already failing commitments.

This is not shutting down airports, further discussions with the tribes on \"treaty issues\" - there are measures to have legal means to stop people from from following these orders. It is a legal order.  \n- Explain how we got to the 250 number for gatherings  \n-- No magic number written in stone tablets. Any number, to some degree, is not precise. After talking to CDC and others, gatherings over 250 cant control the crowd to require social distancing. Businesses should be working to help with lower gatherings. Do \"not want to see people shoulder to shoulder in bars, this is not acceptable\" - Federal guidance should be coming to mirror Washington  \n- Question about containment zone in NY  \n-- We have a great national guard, we will call on them if needed, potential medical assistance through the guard if our hospital system becomes stretched  \n- What advice for parents who have the opportunity to keep kids home  \n-- Inslee is asking the school leadership to prepare today, so they have plans to help with childcare and nutrition (large number of children fed through the school system) - don't go to work if you're ill, talk to grandparents, uncles, and aunts and tell them not to go out in public more than needed - schools need to think about it starting right now, will have more in few days  \n- How does this extend to personal events (weddings, funerals), and what exactly are punishments?  \n-- The penalties are you \"might be killing your grand dad if you don't do it, I'm serious\" - if you're thinking about having a 1000 person wedding right now you can't do that legally, does apply to social gatherings and family gatherings  \n- How will the gatherings limit be enforced  \n-- Dow Constantine: We will have guidance for restaurants and the like, enforcement will be \"by complaint\" - no public health police will be running around, don't have the staff for that. Will rely on cities, businesses, and rely on good sense and good faith to take action to prevent illness  \n-- Dr. Jeff Duchin: for gatherings under 250 attendees, people at risk and elderly are being asked not to attend, period. Social distancing must be kept (stay further away than 6 feet), employees must be screened for symptoms each day and must be excluded if symptomatic. Sanitation must be available. CDC guidelines must be met. Fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat should exclude any employees from working.  \n- What is the county doing to support community clinics?  \n-- Dr. Jeff Duchin: Trying to get healthcare professionals as much info as possible about the virus, ever changing. If ***you don't need to be in a healthcare setting right now, don't go***, this is \"not a good time to visit any healthcare facility if you do not need to be there\" - infection control measures must be taken to prevent spread to other patients but also providers. Identify those that may be at risk. More testing. \"Everyone should understand that there is guidance now on our (website) that will help the public\"  \n-- Inslee: State legislator is soon to appropriate at least $100 Million to help this\n- What about Ferry system with more than 250 people on them? What about us being a liberal democracy and having \"Draconian\" response?  \n-- Inslee: Doesn't think it's draconian to try and prevent more deaths, transportation should do everything possible to allow for social distancing, includes things like more buses and new guidelines for boats, etc. It is our responsibility to protect our community  \n- Could we end up like China (summarized) with their lock down?  \n-- Inslee: That's why we're doing this, that's exactly what we're trying to avoid. Be conscious that we're doing this to try and prevent this.  \n- What about the Asian American community that's being targeted by items related to this?  \n-- Inslee: Proud of Washingtonians for being open and friendly with everyone. If you have an incident related to this, call Inslee or Dow and they'll deal with it.  \n- What about homelessness and homeless population?\n-- Inslee: Looking to continue assistance available to homelessness, wants to get shelter for all of them, wants to get people isolated that needed, prepping areas to isolate like motel and RV.  \n  \nInslee:  \n- Wants to thank everyone, \"wash your hands\"", "created_utc": 1583952256, "complete": true, "id": "fk8a7bd", "link_id": "t3_fh0vql"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fkwmsq8", "subreddit": "CoronavirusUS", "author": "jsalsman", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "I've been studying salt-saturated masks:\n\n&gt; **NaCl-Activated Cloth Mask**\n&gt; \n&gt; \ud83d\udcf9 [Activated masks - for personal pathogenic protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6R1Xjp3lXA) (YouTube)\n&gt; \n&gt; Soak an ordinary non-woven cloth mask in a saturated table salt solution, dry it at 95\u00b0C, include a wire to seal the top against the nose bridge sides, and in so doing gain additional protection against coronavirus infection and transmission, according to this how-to video and references:\n&gt; \n&gt; * Peer reviewed: Quan, et al.

There was no cover-up of the disease.\n\n&gt;A notice posted outside the Huanan Seafood Market market said that according to regulations for public health emergencies, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's Hanjiang district bureau decided to suspend the seafood market's operation to improve its environment and sanitation. The opening time will be further notified. \n\n[Hubei Daily also confirmed](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fepaper.hubeidaily.net%2Fpc%2Fcontent%2F202001%2F01%2Fcontent_15040.html), on the 31st of December, the outbreak of a pneumonia epidemic.\n\n&gt;Their reluctance to go public, in part, played to political motivations as local officials prepared for their annual congresses in January. Even as cases climbed, officials declared repeatedly that there had likely been no more infections.\n\nAs I just demonstrated, the epidemic *was* public.\n\n&gt;By not moving aggressively to warn the public and medical professionals, public health experts say, the Chinese government lost one of its best chances to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic.\n\nAnd a note when the market was closed literally said it was for sanitation purposes, not \"renovation\". Quoting the [China Daily article](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/01/WS5e0c6a49a310cf3e35581e30.html) once again: \n\n&gt;A notice posted outside the Huanan Seafood Market market said that according to regulations for public health emergencies, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's Hanjiang district bureau decided to suspend the seafood market's operation to improve its environment and sanitation. The opening time will be further notified. \n\n&gt;The first case, the details of which are limited and the specific date unknown, was in early December. By the time the authorities galvanized into action on Jan. 20, the disease had grown into a formidable threat.\n\nWuhan notified WHO on the 31st of December: https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6866757\n\nThe genome was sequenced on the 7th: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4\n\n&gt;The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus, which was isolated on 7 January 2020.\n\nIt was deposited to GenBank on the 12th: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.1\n\n&gt;That same day, Wuhan\u2019s health commission, its hand forced by those \u201crumors,\u201d announced that 27 people were suffering from pneumonia of an unknown cause. Its statement said there was no need to be alarmed.\n\nThere was no hand-forcing. An \"urgent notice\" was published one day before, on the 30th: https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6864153\n\n&gt;On the evening of [30 Dec 2019], an \"urgent notice on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\" was issued, which was widely distributed on the Internet by the red-headed document of the Medical Administration and Medical Administration of Wuhan Municipal Health Committee.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d the [statement](https://archive.is/24qxv) said.\n\nCourtesy of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwjw.wuhan.gov.cn%2Ffront%2Fweb%2FshowDetail%2F2019123108989). Maybe it's because they *thought* it was controllable, and it's clear they don't really understand the virus quite yet. Not that it justifies arresting the doctors for \"spreading rumours\", but they weren't hiding the epidemic from the public.\n\n&gt;Viral pneumonia is more common in winter and spring, and can be spread or outbreak. The clinical manifestations are fever, soreness, dyspnea in a small part, and lung infiltration. Viral pneumonia is related to the virulence of the virus, the route of infection, and the age and immune status of the host. Viruses that cause viral pneumonia are common with influenza viruses, others are parainfluenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Confirmation depends on pathogenic tests, including virus isolation, serological tests, and viral antigen and nucleic acid tests. The disease is preventable and controllable, and indoor air circulation is prevented to prevent public places and closed places where there is no air circulation. \n\nFurthermore, it recommends masks and seeking out medical help if you feel ill:\n\n&gt;People can wear masks when going out. Symptomatic treatment is the main clinical practice, and bed rest is required. If you have the above symptoms, especially the persistent fever, you should go to the medical institution in time.\n\n&gt;On Jan. 1, police officers showed up at the market, along with public health officials, and shut it down. Xinhua news agency reported that the market was undergoing renovation, but that morning, workers in hazmat suits moved in, washing out stalls and spraying disinfectants.\n\nXinhua may have reported that, but other Chinese state media did in fact report it as sanitation efforts as I showed above.", "created_utc": 1580601437, "complete": true, "id": "fg7u0to", "link_id": "t3_exbv5z"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fku8dh7", "subreddit": "CoronavirusUS", "author": "lykeomg2themax", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "for people who are not interested in reading this article which is the original report : \n\n\nHonestly, I wasn't sure how to begin this story or how to fit all the insanity into the title. It's a story involving patents, patent trolling, Covid-19, *Theranos*, and even the company that brought us all *WeWork: SoftBank*. Oh, and also *Irell &amp; Manella*, the same law firm that once claimed it could represent a monkey in a copyright infringement dispute. You see, Irell &amp; Manella has now filed one of the most utterly bullshit patent infringement lawsuits you'll ever see. They are representing *\"Labrador Diagnostics LLC\"* a patent troll which does not seem to exist other than to file this lawsuit, and *which claims to hold the rights to two patents (US Patents 8,283,155 and 10,533,994) which, you'll note, were originally granted to Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos* -- the firm that shut down in scandal over medical testing equipment that appears to have been oversold and never actually worked. Holmes is still facing federal charges of wire fraud over the whole Theranos debacle.\nHowever, back in 2018, *the remains of Theranos sold its patents to Fortress Investment Group. Fortress Investment Group is a SoftBank-funded massive patent troll.* You may remember the name from the time last fall when Apple and Intel sued the firm, laying out how *Fortress* is a sort of uber-patent troll, gathering up a bunch of patents and then shaking down basically everyone. Lovely, right?\nSo, this *SoftBank-owned patent troll, Fortress*, bought up *Theranos* patents, and then set up this shell company, *\"Labrador Diagnostics,\"* which decided that right in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic it was going to sue one of the companies making Covid-19 tests, saying that its test violates those *Theranos* patents, and literally demanding that the court bar the firm from making those Covid-19 tests.\nA bit more background here: the company they're suing, *BioFire*, (\ud83d\ude07\u00b4s) recently launched three Covid-19 tests built off of the company's FilmArray technology. And that's what *\"Labrador\" (read: SoftBank*) is now suing over. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 &gt; From the lawsuit:\nThe Accused Products embody at least claim 1 of the '155 Patent, literally or under the doctrine of equivalents, as set forth below. The further descriptions below, which are based on publicly available information, are preliminary examples and are non-limiting. On information and belief, the FilmArray 2.0, FilmArray EZ, and FilmArray Torch devices operate, together with the FilmArray pouches and software, similarly as pertinent to the non-limiting examples set forth below. On information and belief, the FilmArray EZ operates in substantially the same manner as the FilmArray 2.0, and as such is not separately addressed below. For the purposes of infringement, *Plaintiff Labrador's* non-limiting examples relating to the FilmArray 2.0 are equally applicable to the FilmArray EZ, albeit with use of at least the RP EZ Panel designed for use with the FilmArray EZ. See BioFire Diagnostics Website, https://www.biofiredx.com/products/the-filmarraypanels/ filmarray-respiratory-panel-ez/.\n\n\n.: So, let's summarize: The firm that basically created the mess that is *WeWork* by dumping billions of dollars into the company, also owns a patent troll that bought up the patents from the sham medical testing firm *Theranos*, and is now using those patents to sue one of the few diagnostics companies that is actually making a Covid-19 test... in the middle of a pandemic. And, !!! demanding the use of those tests be blocked !!! :\nThat Defendants be enjoined from infringing the Asserted Patents, or if their infringement is not enjoined, that *Defendants be ordered to pay ongoing royalties to Labrador* for any post-judgment infringement of the Asserted Patents;\n\n\n.: Honestly, I'm used to all sorts of awfulness, but this one piles awfulness upon awfulness, and takes it to a level of pure evil. The lawyers filing this lawsuit on behalf of \"*Labrador*\" should remember what they've done -- filing a bullshit patent trolling lawsuit, on behalf of a shell company for a notorious giant patent troll, using patents from a sham company, and using them to try to block the use of Covid-19 diagnostic tests in the middle of a pandemic. I wonder how they sleep at night. \n\n.:For the record, there are two law firms behind this filing. *Irell &amp; Manella* is the big one, and they list out 7 different lawyers on this complaint: *Morgan Chu, Alan Heinrich, Keith Orso, Adina Stohl, Dennis Courtney, Brian Weissenberg and Chaplin Carmichael*. Their local firm is *Farnan LLP, and the lawyers there are Brian and Michael Farnan*. \n\n*Morgan Chu* is the big shot at *Irell* and runs its litigation group. He should take on much of the responsibility for this awful, awful lawsuit. \n\n*Farnan LLP* was formed by a former federal district court judge, *Joseph Farnan*, and I'll just note that 4 out of its 6 attorneys, including the two on this case have the same last name.\nI understand the need for zealous representation of a client in court, but this seems even more despicable than your every day patent trolling, and people should associate these lawyers names with the truly despicable behavior on display here. Similarly, it should be a reminder of why its a good thing that the Supreme Court decided a decade and a half ago that injunctions are often inappropriate in patent cases. I know that there's an effort underway to have Congress change the law to overrule the Supreme Court decision on that point, but imagine how that would play out in this scenario, in which necessary diagnostic testing might get blocked due to some patent troll with deep pockets.", "created_utc": 1584551630, "complete": true, "id": "fkulj5d", "link_id": "t3_fkr0fl"}, {"parent_id": "t3_fmcotk", "subreddit": "Philippines", "author": "johnny_mcnuggets", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": true}, "body": "I wanted to do the decent thing and ask her how's she's doing.

I was born with a genetically weak immunesystem (meaning my body don\u2019t produce enough antibodies) and I\u2019m allergic against pencillin and several antibiotics. Meaning the risk of common everyday infections for me is like the risk the corona virus poses to normal healthy people. \nMy guide is based on tips from my doctors who told me how to avoid getting sick, things I picked up by specialists and yeah just living a life being immunocromised. These are things that works for me during flu season. Basically I\u2019ve had to learn these kinda things otherwise I would be constantly sick. So during flu season I generally do these things but to a lesser degree. \n\n- Avoid all public transport, eating at restaurants and coffee shops, going to public places like cinema, clothing stores. \n- Avoid bars and instead hang out with your friends at home, shop online and yeah just avoid crowded stores.\n- Travel with your own car, walk or take a bike, or ask a friend to share a car with you. If your economy will allow it maybe leasing a car if you don\u2019t own one etc etc. Public transport is legit the worst contamination place.\n- Prepare and cook all your own meals. Do not rely on strangers making your food in a restaurant where you have no idea what their current health status is. (This one I can say made the biggest change for me in my life. When I stopped going to restaurants I went from constantly getting sick to almost never getting sick)\n- Invest in a Air purifier with hepa filter. Hepa filters actually cleans out viruses and bacteria as well as pollen and allergens, it makes sure your air at home is getting clean. Works great against all pollution coming in from the windows. For people living together it cleans the air preventing people catching a cold from another family member. It can be a good idea to pitch to managers where you work to invest in air purifiers for work as well. It\u2019s proven that offices with air purifiers have less flu and cold outbreaks at work.\n- Go to food store late at night when it\u2019s less people or early when the store just opened way before busy rush hour.\n- Buy antibacterial/anti viral gel and handwash like dettol and carex are well known brands\n- Always wear gloves when going outside and washing them frequently with antibacterial machine wash\n- regularly wipe off your phone, door knobs, car interior like steering wheel and exterior car door handle and other places frequently touched places with antibactrial/anti virus cleaning wipes.\n- Ask your friends and family before meeting them if they have a cold, if they do, don\u2019t meet them as getting a cold will weaken your immunesystem and making you more prone to the flu and other infections in the future\n- get a n99 or n95 mask for safety, just make sure it\u2019s not made in China recently as that would defy the purpose \ud83d\ude43\n- ask your employer how they will prepare for a possible outbreak, are staff allowed to work from home etc etc.\n\n\n- Bonus one; How to spot sick people? The obvious are of course coughing, sneezing etc, but the given tell is tired eyes and runny and watery eyes. However if you\u2019re close enough to see that, well that\u2019s not good. Usually before a person gets sick their eyes start to look very watery. It was even visible on the British couple of the diamond princess cruise.

I honestly believe mortality rates could be as high as 50% for this population yet I doubt it will make headlines.\n\nI am a nurse working for a human services organization in a community setting in the US. I work with Individuals with Severe Intellectual and Developmental disabilities. Despite the severity and nature of many of their disabilities they are very much like you and I. These are real people, with feelings, fears, life goals, hopes and dreams that reside within many community settings in America. My employer operates several day programs and quite a few group homes (medical and non-medical) that these individual's reside in. I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn about their lives, needs and medical fragility in a comprehensive way in my role as the agency healthcare supervisor. As helpless as I have felt at times this week, I hope that speaking about their plight will at the very least help to spread awareness and hopefully some voluntary support, within your own communities if the need arises.\n\nI honestly never thought that in the course of my career there would come a time where I would be terrified for the health and welfare of so many people that I have come to truly love and care for. The following reasons are why I think so many could potentially perish: \n\nThe department of developmental services has thus far failed to issue any guidance, and for many smaller agencies like the one I am employed by, I am their highest level of medical expertise in a potentially deadly crisis...I only have a bachelors of science in nursing. \n\nThis entire week I have had to run so many nightmare scenarios in my mind in an effort to create contingency plans that I am mentally and emotionally exhausted. What if our staff become too ill to care for our patients and are unable to provide care that is literally necessary to sustain life? How many could die? What is the mitigation? What if they get any of these individuals sick? How quickly would it spread? With no current reliable rapid test, how can I and my nursing staff quickly identify and isolate? When most are so vulnerable to viral illness that many currently have flu like symptoms with several having progressed to pneumonia. I did the best I could with the resources and knowledge available to me to help my agency prepare. But clinically my own assessment is that at best, it will buy us some time but realistically won't be enough to be truly effective in the long run.\n\nThere are no government contingency plans to assist our facilities with emergency supplies of medical protective equipment...or staffing if need becomes critical. I suspect they have the capabilities to do so as DDS also runs its own facilities and group homes, in many states on a large scale. But for this vulnerable population, severely underfunded non-profit agencies have thus far been left to figure out their own contingency and mitigation plans. \n\nOn the most basic level most of my patients have little to no concept of proper hygiene. Many have poor hygiene and hygiene practices for various reasons ranging from water aversion, tactile issues, diffuclties with recall all the way to caregiver inability/difficulty in providing necessary care. So this effective prevention tool will be ineffective. I can respond in more detail about the non-medical components if anyone is interested.\n\nIn terms of the medical piece this is an extremely fragile group of people, many have complicated co-morbidities such as compromised immune systems, respiratory systems, cardiac systems and on and on. Most of my patients have disabilities that are profound and require a lot of medical and direct supportive care. Some are vent dependent, some with traches...many require careful respiratory management. The regular flu strains kill a disproportionate amount in this community every year. I cannot even begin to imagine how many of my own could die due to the direct and indirect results of this virus. \n\nThe worst part is how completely and utterly hopeless this situation is starting to seem due to the complete mismanagement and lack of leadership in our current administration.", "created_utc": 1583003869, "complete": true, "id": "fj4agpq", "link_id": "t3_fbb4yt"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fl429xi", "subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "thottydetector", "emotion": {"disgust": true, "trust": true, "neutral": false, "anger": true, "sadness": true, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": true, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "So, I vape.

I joke: \"Maybe it'll be your last.** He's not laughing. I feel like shit.\n\n**Sunday, March 1st**\n\nThe result of the roommate of the Corona OG has arrived. Corona Lite is negative. We are thrilled. The hope that also Corinna has a negative test is rising. He hopes that this will shorten his quarantine period and that he will be able to take part in the exams he has been preparing for so long.\n\nWe are waiting with tension for the result. The doctors take good care of us and contact us several times by phone. I think to myself that this must be incredibly stressful and time-consuming to contact all Ronnys at risk of infection individually. I offer my e-mail address. No this is not allowed for DSGVO reasons. Here the system in Germany is about 20 years behind. E-Mail is a standard since 1993, why can't everybody get a PGP Public Key and receive signed, encrypted e-mails. How many working hours, or rather time to recover, could be made possible for the visibly overworked doctors by this. Even an end-to-end encrypted communication via signal or telegram would be conceivable. But before something like this happens in Germany, we all pay in Bitcoin.\n\n**Monday, 02 March**\n\nI have a dry cough. I try to go out on the balcony to get some fresh air regularly, but the radiators keep the ambient air consistently equivalent in temperature and humidity to Phoenix Arizona in August.\n\nAfter the public order office announced twice a day to make sure Corinna doesn't escape, today is the first time you come. You say that you will now only come once a day. Apart from the fact that the Public Order Office has never been there twice a day before, this is of course a Big Brain Move to tell people that you have been there once today and won't come again. If someone wanted to leave his quarantine now, he would now have a clearly defined time window. But I cannot blame the staff. I'd rather forgive parking tickets in the pedestrian zone than bring my family viruses for dinner at the hourly rate. The medical staff are provided with Tyvek suits and masks. The people from the public order office are indistinguishable from the traffic wardens.\n\nCorinna is still asymptomatic. There is still no result.\n\n**Tuesday, 03 March**\n\nThe results are in. Corinna has always been a model pupil and has also passed this test. Positive for SARS-CoV-2. I am strengthened in my decision that it was wise not to follow the public order office and instead stay in the flat share and not to go to my relatives.\n\nI am now also being called. Although I am self-employed, I am getting a promotion. From K2 to K1. Everythings's coming up Milhouse. K1 is a contact person with an increased risk of infection. I'll be verbally committed to a legally binding quarantine. Until when? When was the last time you had contact with Corinna? He's in the next room. When was the last time you had contact with him without a mask? Thursday. To determine my quarantine period, we do not take the fact that we still live in the same apartment as before, but we assume the optimized case that our spatial separation and the meticulous disinfection of the shared sanitary facilities worked 100%. The fact that I could have been infected only today when I handed over the rice pudding is neglected here. The beginning of my quarantine was Thursday.\n\nIn the morning a team of doctors will come by and take a smear test on me. If the test is negative, I will be allowed to leave the quarantine on 12 March.\n\nThe doctors will roll up and change their clothes in the stairwell. Face mask, hair protection, glasses, disposable gowns. They come in and interrogate me in the kitchen about my contacts since February 20th. I'm not supposed to contact anyone yet. I am not forbidden to do so, but I am advised not to cause unnecessary mass panic. That's understandable. To this day, even my parents don't know what's happening to me. I lied to my mother about drowning in work and not being able to come home for a while.\n\nCorinna, on the other hand, now has to name all his contacts and they are called by the health department. The doctors insist that I do the smear test in my room and walk over my carpet with their usual shoes. There seem to be no more overshoes. My temperature is measured with a laser thermometer on my forehead. 36.3\u00b0. All Gucci.\n\nMy result should come tomorrow. The doctors are trying to organize an isolated hospital bed for Corinna so that I don't have to share the apartment with a person who tested positive.\n\nThe doctors are trying really hard and are polite but you can tell that you don't have the right answers and you have been thrown into the deep end with Corona. Yesterday you were a general practitioner in a town with 90.000 souls, today you are at the spearhead of a global epidemic. The Robert Koch Institute provides all information but especially about the course of the disease there are still many unanswered questions. **I wish we had a health minister without chancellor aspirations; I wish we didn't have this clown in the White House; I wish I hadn't seen the film Contagion.**\n\nMeanwhile our case is in the newspapers. Acquaintances and friends send me the articles and memes without suspecting my direct connection. The press reports about our concrete case with astonishing accuracy. I recognize myself and my roommate by the job title. Only my age is wrong. My birthday is tomorrow.\n\n\n\n**So far the conclusion** is that the public health department and the public order officials in the city are doing their best. But in my boundless pessimism, I believe that things will get worse before they get better. We can only hope that most of the infected people do not have any chronic pre-existing conditions and that the virus only leads to a small flu-like infection. There is hope that there will be a vaccine available soon to protect the elderly population before the virus has spread too far in our society.\n\nBut every cloud also has a silver lining.

To wit:\n\n[Instillation of particulate matter 2.5 induced acute lung injury and attenuated the injury recovery in ACE2 knockout mice ](https://www.ijbs.com/v14p0253.htm) and all its previous citations.\n\n&gt; Inhaled particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) can cause lung injury by inducing serious inflammation in lung tissue. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases and regulates inflammatory response. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), which is produced through the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin II (Ang II) axis, protects against lung disease. However, few studies have focused on the relationships between PM2.5 and ACE2. Therefore, we aimed to explore the role of ACE2 in PM2.5-induced acute lung injury (ALI). An animal model of PM2.5-induced ALI was established with wild type (C57BL/6, WT) and ACE2 gene knockout (ACE2 KO) mice. The mice were exposed to PM2.5 through intratracheal instillation once a day for 3 days (6.25 mg/kg/day) and then sacrificed at 2 days and 5 days after PM2.5 instillation. The results show that resting respiratory rate (RRR), levels of inflammatory cytokines, ACE and MMPs in the lungs of WT and ACE2 KO mice were significantly increased at 2 days postinstillation. At 5 days postinstillation, the PM2.5-induced ALI significantly recovered in the WT mice, but only partially recovered in the ACE2 KO mice. The results hint that PM2.5 could induce severe ALI through pulmonary inflammation, and the repair after acute PM2.5 postinstillation could be attenuated in the absence of ACE2. Additionally, our results show that PM2.5-induced ALI is associated with signaling p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3 pathways and ACE2 knockdown could increase pulmonary p-STAT3 and p-ERK1/2 levels in the PM2.5-induced ALI.\n\nCompared with ACE, the importance of ACE2 in PM2.5-induced ALI is seldom discussed. Imai et al. reported that ACE2 has protective functions in murine lungs and can attenuate the acute injury induced by ARDS and SARS. In addition, ACE2 acts as a central role in lung endothelial function and pathophysiology. For example, lung injury induced by cigarette smoke exposure, and pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin are associated with ACE2 activity. In our study, ACE2 expression in the lung increased at 2 and 5 days postinstillation (Fig. 8B), and PM2.5-induced ALI in ACE2 KO mice was more severe than that in WT mice. We speculated that the activation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis is absent in ACE2 KO mice. Thus, ACE2 KO mice sustained severe injuries and inflammation from PM2.5 exposure. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that ACE2 has a protective role against lung injury induced by PM2.5.\n\n[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus as an Agent of Emerging and Reemerging Infection](https://cmr.asm.org/content/20/4/660)\n\n&gt; The key receptor of the host cell attached by S is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a metalloprotease expressed in the cells of the lung, intestine, liver, heart, vascular endothelium, testis, and kidney. Since ACE2 was shown to protect against acute lung injury in a mouse model and since the binding of the S protein to host cells results in the downregulation of ACE2, this mechanism may contribute to the severity of lung damage in SARS. Cells expressing some lectins, including DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and LSECtin, have been shown to augment the cellular entry of pseudotype virus expressing S but only in the concomitant presence of ACE2 . Nonsusceptible cells expressing these lectins in the absence of ACE2, such as dendritic cells, were able to promote the cell-mediated transfer of SARS-CoV to susceptible cells.", "created_utc": 1581983154, "complete": true, "id": "fhyt3il", "link_id": "t3_f5f4k8"}, {"parent_id": "t3_fif4jg", "subreddit": "CoronaVirus_2019_nCoV", "author": "EasyBizz", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "URL is being hugged to death.

He's dressed pretty casually, jeans and a polo; she's got on a somewhat \"fancy\" looking sundress thing. My friend Diego is their server, gets their drinks (lemonade and a coke). Everything is cool so far.\n\nWell, she's constantly on her phone while he's trying to make conversation. They look over the mine a few times and I overhear he decides to go with the Al Pastor burger (that tends to be the most popular with our latino crowd as Al Pastor is a fairly Mexican seasoned pork). \n\nHe takes a break and goes to the bathroom and Diego comes around to see if she's ready to order. At this point I got a little busy so I couldn't pay too much attention.\n\nHe comes back and walks by me. I ask \"Buenas tardes. Todo bien? Algo m\u00e1s de tomar?\" (Good afternoon, everything good?

Yep.\nShe decided that her tastes were more important and she ordered them the Veggie Burger - split. Now for a Mexican like myself and him, an all veggie meal is pretty offensive.

They flew 149 miles before landing in the waters between North Korea and Japan, the officials said, adding that they were analyzing data to determine the type of projectiles used in the launch.\n\nSouth Korean officials said the launch on Monday appeared to be part of a military drill North Korea began on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis kind of act by North Korea does not help efforts to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the South Korean military said in a statement. \u201cWe once again urge the North to immediately stop it.\u201d\n\nIn its previous weapons test on Nov. 28, North Korea launched two rockets from its east coast, firings that were overseen by Mr. Kim, the country\u2019s leader. South Korea later said the two short-range projectiles were fired from what North Korea called a \u201csuper-large multiple rocket launcher,\u201d a new weapon the North had developed to target South Korean and United States military bases farther from North Korea\u2019s border with the South.\n\nBut North Korea had been refraining from any weapons tests since Mr. Kim told a meeting at the end of December that he had all but abandoned hopes for diplomacy with Washington and ordered his country to brace for a prolonged standoff with the United States and endure sanctions. In that meeting, Mr. Kim also said his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles and that the world would witness a new strategic weapon \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\n\nMr. Kim has also been keeping himself largely from public view as he locked his country down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus outbreak from neighboring China. On Friday, he appeared to resume his public activities, inspecting a joint strike drill of units of the North Korean People\u2019s Army, according to the state-run media.\n\n\nThe military drill coincided with the anniversary of Mr. Kim\u2019s summit last year with President Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam. The summit collapsed over differences over how fast North Korea would roll back its nuclear weapons program and when Washington should ease sanctions.\n\n\nThe Monday launch came three days after Mr. Kim fired one of his closest aides for corruption during a meeting of the Political Bureau of his Workers\u2019 Party. The meeting focused on \u201cenforcing top-class anti-epidemic measures to contain the viral epidemic spreading rapidly across the world,\u201d although the North itself has not reported any cases of the new coronavirus.\nDuring the meeting, Mr. Kim excoriated \u201cabuse of power, practices of privileges, indulgence in bureaucracy, corruption and irregularities\u201d among senior officials of the party\u2019s Central Committee and at the party\u2019s cadre-training center.\n\nThen, the rubber-stamp Political Bureau dismissed Ri Man-gon and Pak Thae-dok from the posts of vice-chairmen of the Central Committee, it said.\n\nMr. Ri was one of the most prominent North Korean officials to fall out of Mr. Kim\u2019s favor in recent years. As vice chairman of the Central Committee, Mr. Ri has helped Mr. Kim in monitoring the loyalty of the party elites and helping Mr. Kim decide whom to promote or demote. Mr. Ri has also led the party\u2019s powerful Department of Organization and Guidance, which does the same work.\n\n\nThe North\u2019s latest launch, the first in three months, came at a time when South Korea was grappling with an explosive outbreak of the coronavirus, with more than 4,000 cases, the largest number outside China.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s first weapons test this year came days after the United States and South Korea postponed their joint annual military drills, originally scheduled for this month, because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nNorth Korea \u201cappears intent on raising the stakes before South Korea\u2019s April elections and before the Super Tuesday primaries of the U.S. presidential campaign,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \u201cNorth Korea is making clear with these missile tests it will continue to improve military capabilities and make outsized demands, despite the political and public health preoccupations of Beijing, Seoul and Washington.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea holds its parliamentary elections on April 15.", "created_utc": 1583182315, "complete": true, "id": "fjax6k9", "link_id": "t3_fc6tzp"}, {"parent_id": "t1_c4ptxw3", "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author": "JeanVanDeVelde", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "The only good deals I found in Melbourne were at the outlet mall by Southern Cross Station.\n\n$80 for last year's AFL game that might not even work in the US?  $16 for a Corona 6-pack?  $135 because my bag was \"2.3 kilos\" overweight at the airport?

Some economists have cheered the idea as the right move at a fraught moment when workers are quarantined, schools are closing and large gatherings are being canceled.\n\nBut others \u2014 including those who have called for aggressive congressional action \u2014 say the plan would be an inefficient way of stoking consumer demand at a time of supply shortages and a growing number of quarantines.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have given the proposal a cool reception. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Wednesday that he did not see a need for immediate action on a payroll tax cut. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the second-ranking Democrat in the House, said Wednesday that the proposal was a \u201cnonstarter.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his top advisers have pitched the cut as a much-needed lift for consumers and businesses at a time when the spreading virus is beginning to chill economic activity. \u201cThe payroll tax holiday is probably the most important, powerful piece of this,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump\u2019s plan \u2014 as described by Peter Navarro, one of his economic advisers \u2014 the government would, through the end of the year, stop collecting the 6.2 percent Social Security tax currently taken out of workers\u2019 paychecks and the 1.45 percent tax taken for Medicare. It would also suspend equally large taxes paid on behalf of workers by their employers. Self-employed workers would be relieved of the entire 15.3 percent tax they currently pay.\n\nFor workers, earnings that are no longer subject to the payroll tax would now be subject to federal income taxes. Because lower-paid workers have lower marginal income tax rates, they would see a slightly larger percentage increase in their pay than workers with higher salaries. Some extremely high-paid workers would not see an increase at all because payroll taxes are capped by income, and some workers are close to \u2014 or have already reached \u2014 that limit. This means they are not set to have any Social Security taxes taken out for the rest of the year.\n\nAs a general rule, the largest percentage income gains would go to households earning up to $250,000 a year, according to calculations by the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit in Washington. The largest gains in dollar figures would go to households earning more than $123,000 a year, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington.\n\nHow much individual workers would save depends partly on their employers. If an employer\u2019s half of payroll taxes was lifted, they would need to decide whether to pass those savings directly to workers in the form of higher pay. Some economists see both sides of that equation as beneficial at a time of slowing economic activity.\n\nThe full payroll tax suspension \u201cwould not only increase workers\u2019 take-home pay but would ease cash flow constraints for employers who are likely to face a rough patch in the incoming months,\u201d said Karl Smith, the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation, which traditionally supports cutting taxes to spur economic growth. Mr. Smith said he supported the Trump proposal, though the Tax Foundation had not taken an official position.\n\n\u201cThe payroll tax would be great,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cDems are not in favor of it. I\u2019m trying to figure out why.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are opposed for several reasons. Many economists, including liberals and conservatives who have called for stimulus measures, say there are much more effective ways to stoke demand and support growth during a viral outbreak. They note that cutting payroll taxes only helps Americans who are still working \u2014 and not those who are furloughed by quarantines or laid off amid floundering sales. The benefits would arrive gradually across paychecks instead of in one stimulative burst.\n\n\u201cA payroll tax cut like the president wants wouldn\u2019t help the elderly, non-employed, who are at the most risk from the virus,\u201d Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote Wednesday on Twitter. \u201cIt would provide a larger benefit to the well off. And it isn\u2019t targeted on those who need it.\u201d\n\nClaudia Sahm, an economist at the liberal Washington Center for Equitable Growth, said Thursday that lawmakers could still ward off a recession with stimulus, but \u201ca payroll tax won\u2019t do it.\u201d She and Mr. Strain both favor giving cash assistance to Americans.\n\nCutting payroll taxes \u201cwill be too slow, and its effects too small,\u201d Ms. Sahm said. \u201cSo small most won\u2019t even notice it. Those who don\u2019t have or will lose their jobs won\u2019t get it at all.\u201d\n\nThe political calculations around payroll tax cuts are fraught. The tax feeds the Social Security Trust Fund; while administration officials said they would most likely divert other money to avoid robbing the fund, cutting payroll taxes would further balloon the rising budget deficit.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that suspending the tax through December would reduce federal revenues by $840 billion; the Tax Foundation said it could top $900 billion. The initial price tag for the 2008 Wall Street bailout was $700 billion, though less than $500 billion was actually spent and taxpayers ultimately recouped most of the funds. President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus package cost about $800 billion over the course of several years.\n\nThe full cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals, including assistance to affected industries like tourism and sick pay for quarantined workers, is likely to be tens \u2014 if not hundreds \u2014 of billions of dollars larger than the payroll tax cut alone.\n\nIf enacted, such a package would most likely push the federal budget deficit to over $2 trillion for the year. Data released Thursday by the Treasury Department show the deficit \u2014 which has grown significantly in recent years in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts \u2014 is on pace to reach nearly $1.1 trillion for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nThe record in nominal dollars for an annual deficit in the United States is $1.4 trillion, during the depths of the financial crisis.", "created_utc": 1584572096, "complete": true, "id": "fkvm8sj", "link_id": "t3_fkqarp"}, {"parent_id": "t3_ffpila", "subreddit": "argentina", "author": "empleadoEstatalBot", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "#####&amp;#009;\n\n######&amp;#009;\n\n####&amp;#009;\n\n&gt; # [Richard Hatchett, experto en epidemias: \u201cEl coronavirus es la enfermedad m\u00e1s aterradora con la que me encontr\u00e9 en mi carrera\u201d](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/_hVirE2DA8R32XzGQlRaJ6auwkk=/1200x0/filters:quality(100\\)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-infobae.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HCMBBBAK7BCX5PSLPGTRKE5DMU.jpg)\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;   \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;  \"Esta es la enfermedad m\u00e1s aterradora con la que me encontr\u00e9 en mi carrera\" \n&gt; \n&gt;  **\u201cNo quiero hacer una predicci\u00f3n porque pienso que lo que suceda con este virus depende, en realidad, de nosotros\u201d,** asegur\u00f3 con gesto de preocupaci\u00f3n el doctor Richard Hatchett cuando la periodista de canal brit\u00e1nico Channel 4 le pregunt\u00f3 si el nuevo coronavirus podr\u00eda compararse con la brutal gripe espa\u00f1ola, que mat\u00f3 a 50 millones de personas entre 1918 y 1920.

The Change of Consciousness to which we are all invited. A more empathetic future, a new humanity. For our children. For health, fulfillment and happiness for ALL. The 10 lessons of this term\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qgighVQrJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qgighVQrJA) \n\n\\# 1 We are all One. Without borders or color distinctions of any kind. Humanity is a system, and as such, if any part fails, there is dysfunction in the whole. Individualism destroys us. # 2 For our children. We are all vulnerable and only togetherness and reaction together allow us to transcend. Let us share this vital message with future generations. For a new order. #zetageneration # 3 The importance of #Respect for others and collaboration because it results in our own sustainability. We are connected among all and with the All. Likewise, and thanks to isolation, we value the vital energy that social relationships represent. We are emotional beings. #visionintegral # 4 Stop! Let us be aware of the society we have created. Let's stop running all day without knowing where. Let us return to home, to introspection, reflection, silence, to the essentials to start, without noise, from our Interior and our Center. If not, this gift of Life is meaningless #yomequedoencasa #atman # 5 Turbulences are warnings about the Change that is necessary. So let's not be afraid. On the contrary. Let us feel fortunate to participate in this historic human transformation to which we are all invited. # success # 6 It is a huge opportunity. We have no more time to begin the transformation. Awareness of the true truth about Life. So this is positive, because this sanitary setback can be healed. And because it is about evolutionary impulses #optimism # 7 An invitation to accelerate the new world order. Empathy, temperance, understanding, collaboration, gratitude, acceptance, flexibility, humility, strength, forgiveness, resilience, integration, integrity and transcendence. Evolution that is already a fact. It is simply a matter of accepting and #fluir. # 8 beings with their own light that we need to live experiences with others similar (that not equal). In diversity is human wealth. And in humanity experienced with others is the path of transcendence. Fullness is there, harmony and, therefore, constant and true happiness. The one that we have tried so hard to look for outside. #coherence # 9 A virus that takes advantage of low defenses. The ones we have achieved due to stress and social inconsistencies. Love is the most powerful medicine to strengthen our defenses. If we understand that we are a group, we will come out even stronger than we have ever imagined. A much more contagious power than any #pandemic. #contagion\n\n\\# 10 This Alarm State is the call to integrate this learning right now, to dismiss the obstinacy of believing that we have some kind of control. Let's forget the old habit of learning through suffering. We are called to live! Living in HARMONY with the Universe, with our planet and with the rest of living beings. It is the gift that is waiting for us so that we live in fullness, happiness and abundance. #to procrastinate\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u00a0\\# covid19, #wakeup, #zgeneration, #centennial, #estevirusloparamosjuntos, #global, #visionintegral, #centauro, #yomequedoencasa, #atman, # success, #fluir, #coherence, #procrastinate, #consciousness, #evolution, #personalgrowth , # self-help #book", "created_utc": 1585064405, "complete": true, "id": "fldh3sk", "link_id": "t3_fo2j58"}, {"parent_id": "t1_fkqfbax", "subreddit": "france", "author": "Experience111", "emotion": {"disgust": false, "trust": false, "neutral": false, "anger": false, "sadness": false, "pessimism": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "fear": false, "optimism": false, "anticipation": false, "joy": false}, "body": "**Ces m\u00e9dicaments sont-ils difficiles \u00e0 manier ?**\n\nLa chloroquine, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un m\u00e9dicament \u00e0 marge th\u00e9rapeutique \u00e9troite, est \u00ab hautement toxique en cas de surdosage, particuli\u00e8rement chez les enfants \u00bb, \u00e9crit le r\u00e9seau fran\u00e7ais des centres r\u00e9gionaux de pharmacovigilance (CRPV) sur son site, dans un texte dat\u00e9 du 5 mars. La gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019intoxication aigu\u00eb \u00ab provient du caract\u00e8re pr\u00e9coce et brutal de survenue des troubles cardio-vasculaires \u00bb, souligne le r\u00e9seau.\n\n\u00ab Chez l\u2019adulte, la dose dangereuse est estim\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de 2 g de chloroquine en une prise \u00bb (une dose \u00e0 comparer avec les 500 mg deux fois par jour recommand\u00e9s dans le protocole chinois de traitement du Covid-19). \u00ab En l\u2019\u00e9tat des connaissances actuelles, (\u2026) la chloroquine ne pr\u00e9sente pas une balance b\u00e9n\u00e9fice-risque favorable dans la prise en charge des infections \u00e0 coronavirus Covid-19, estime le r\u00e9seau des CRPV. Ainsi, son utilisation dans cette indication doit donc \u00eatre actuellement exclue, en dehors d\u2019essais cliniques ou de prises en charge sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es. \u00bb\n\n**La chloroquine est-elle \u00e0 risque pour les femmes enceintes ?**\n\nEn 2018, Sanofi a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ANSM une modification des informations concernant la chloroquine, les autorit\u00e9s japonaises ayant identifi\u00e9 en 2015-2016 un risque g\u00e9notoxique (d\u00e9l\u00e9t\u00e8re sur les g\u00e8nes) pour un m\u00e9dicament de la m\u00eame famille, la primaquine.\n\nL\u2019analyse conduite par l\u2019Agence, \u00e0 partir de donn\u00e9es de la litt\u00e9rature et de celles fournies par le laboratoire, \u00ab a mis en \u00e9vidence que la chloroquine est g\u00e9notoxique, qu\u2019il existe des incertitudes sur le risque canc\u00e9rog\u00e8ne et qu\u2019elle a un impact sur la fertilit\u00e9 et des effets t\u00e9ratog\u00e8nes [malformations] et f\u0153to-l\u00e9taux chez le rat \u00bb, indique l\u2019ANSM. Compte tenu de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments et \u00ab conform\u00e9ment aux recommandations europ\u00e9ennes \u00bb, pr\u00e9cise-t-elle, l\u2019Agence a demand\u00e9 de faire figurer sur les notices et les RCP la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour les femmes et les hommes d\u2019une contraception pendant le traitement par chloroquine et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 8 mois apr\u00e8s son arr\u00eat. Il est aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que cette mol\u00e9cule ne doit pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e en cas de grossesse, sauf en absence d\u2019alternatives plus s\u00fbres. Le RCP de l\u2019hydroxychloroquine a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens.\n\nA la demande de l\u2019ANSM, les laboratoires Sanofi sont en train de r\u00e9aliser des \u00e9tudes compl\u00e9mentaires pour mieux caract\u00e9riser le risque g\u00e9notoxique de ces deux mol\u00e9cules.\n\n\u00ab La g\u00e9notoxicit\u00e9 peut concerner les cellules reproductrices, spermatozo\u00efdes et ovocytes. A un certain niveau de risque, cela pose donc la question de l\u2019obligation de contraception et d\u2019une contre-indication pendant la grossesse, explique la docteure Sophie Gautier (CRPV de Lille), membre du groupe de travail \u00ab grossesse \u00bb de l\u2019ANSM. En ce qui concerne le risque t\u00e9ratog\u00e8ne de la chloroquine, on ne peut pas l\u2019exclure mais il n\u2019y a pas de signal clinique. \u00bb\n\nEn d\u00e9calage avec ces mentions sur les RCP et les notices, le site Internet du centre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur les agents t\u00e9ratog\u00e8nes (CRAT), destin\u00e9 aux m\u00e9decins, \u00e9crit que, \u00ab dans le paludisme, l\u2019utilisation de la chloroquine est possible, quel que soit le terme de la grossesse \u00bb. Dans les autres pathologies, \u00ab si la chloroquine est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quilibre maternel, son utilisation est possible quel que soit le terme de la grossesse, \u00e0 la dose efficace la plus faible possible \u00bb. Une discordance assum\u00e9e par la docteure Elisabeth Elefant, responsable du CRAT, qui insiste sur les \u00ab tr\u00e8s nombreuses et rassurantes \u00bb donn\u00e9es chez les femmes enceintes expos\u00e9es \u00e0 la chloroquine.\n\n\u00ab Cette mol\u00e9cule a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s largement utilis\u00e9e en Afrique pendant des d\u00e9cennies et il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 de malformations, pr\u00e9cise-t-elle. Quant aux donn\u00e9es de g\u00e9notoxicit\u00e9, ce sont des tests faits en premier lieu pour \u00e9valuer les risques canc\u00e9rig\u00e8nes et, de ce point de vue, nous n\u2019avons pas d\u2019inqui\u00e9tude document\u00e9e pour la chloroquine. Enfin, s\u2019agissant d\u2019une potentielle atteinte des cellules reproductrices qui conduirait \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes en cas de grossesse, on s\u2019inspire des donn\u00e9es des m\u00e9dicaments canc\u00e9reux comme le cyclophosphamide, mais ici c\u2019est un risque th\u00e9orique. \u00bb\n\nFace aux nouvelles pr\u00e9conisations, \u00ab ing\u00e9rables et infond\u00e9es \u00bb, selon les termes de la docteure Elefant, surtout pour l\u2019hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) \u2013 largement plus prescrite que la chloroquine pour des maladies inflammatoires \u2013, la responsable du CRAT et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes de m\u00e9decine interne de rhumatologie et de dermatologie ont plaid\u00e9 en 2018 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019ANSM pour faire \u00e9voluer le dossier. \u00ab La France est le seul pays \u00e0 demander une contraception jusqu\u2019\u00e0 huit mois apr\u00e8s la fin du traitement, alors m\u00eame que le Plaquenil fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un essai chez des femmes, en pr\u00e9vention des fausses couches \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00bb, note encore Mme Elefant.\nLire aussi Coronavirus : des donn\u00e9es rassurantes chez les femmes enceintes\n\nPour les prescripteurs, c\u2019est surtout la perspective de contre-indication pendant la grossesse qui posait probl\u00e8me. \u00ab Je n\u2019ai aucune arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e sur le rapport b\u00e9n\u00e9fice-risque du Plaquenil dans le lupus. L\u2019interdire pendant la grossesse, compte tenu des donn\u00e9es rassurantes dont nous disposons, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement probl\u00e9matique. Heureusement, en concertation avec l\u2019ANSM, nous avons pu faire \u00e9voluer la mention sur la grossesse dans le RCP, avec des termes un peu plus positifs \u00bb, souligne la m\u00e9decin interniste Nathalie Costedoat-Chalumeau. En pratique, les m\u00e9decins continuent \u00e0 prescrire ce m\u00e9dicament chez les femmes enceintes qui en ont besoin.

Faith is based on evidence. It's just a different kind of evidence. \n\nImagine that you're having a conversation with your best friend and he tells you that he had witnessed a terrible accident the night before. Since you have known him for years and have come to trust him (evidence), you believe him (faith). \n\nThe \"evidence\" here is of a different variety than your usual quantifiable, measurable, repeatable sort (it would be difficult to graph). But that's not to say that it isn't evidence. We come to trust someone by a sort of intuitive \"scientific\" method by which we consider the events which constitute our relationships and judge, over time, whether trust (or faith) is warranted. \n\nLess intimate is the similar sort of trust (faith) we put in \"Institutional Science\": we believe that the community of scientists, by and large, are competent and devoted to the scientific method and truth. Therefore, we trust an astronomer when she tells us that the sun's corona is two million degrees Kelvin.  And I think we're reasonable to do so. \n\nIs it possible that our friend or the astronomer are mistaken? Sure. Can we go out on our own and gather data to vindicate or disprove them? Yes. But sometimes, due to an event's unrepeatability or the impracticality of doing the investigation on one's own, you simply have to take another person at their word, realizing that they might be mistaken.\n\nThis isn't belief *without evidence*, it's belief based on the trustworthiness of another, which is established by *evidence*. \n\nI believe this is the Judeo-Christian understanding of faith. Faith is always regarded as a trust, a holding-fast (emunah), to another who is dependable.

Also this border is extremely inhospitable climatewise with some of the highest troops concentration due to the border disputes between India china. In short very very little civilian crossing. They are more likely to shoot you first on either side.\n\nScreening of symptomatic passengers with thermal scans Began on the same day with community based surveillance and quarantine of more than 5000 suspected asymptomatic passengers while they where being tested.\n\nIndia also progressively started banning travel from Singapore, Hong Kong etc at the earliest as this started spreading and was cancelling visa for nationals from those countries preventing them from even getting on the flight.\n\nAlso India is considerably lucky that people contact with China, South Korea and Japan the main epicentres is so limited considering the huge trade relationships. There are only I believe three direct flights to mainland China and South Korea has transit through Singapore which was already stopped.\n\nThe evacuation of people from Wuhan was considerably well handled by professionals and all WHO recommended protection practises where followed. especially now that we are hearing news of how the United States botched the evacuation operations and allowed for community transmissions.\n\nAlso though Indian health care has huge deficiencies there are very competent set of medical professionals in most of the states and proper quarantine and isolation protocols formulated and followed. Infact India is a low cost medical tourism centre and private hospitals that cater to the well off are very well equiped even by first world standards.\n\nBUT that's where the good news stops. Now that community transmission has been established in Europe and the US it's only a matter of time before the person to person transmission starts in India. India has got huge people to people contact with US and Europe especially Italy is a massive holiday destination.\n\nInfact I believe the first asymptomatic travellers have already entered India from Iran or Europe which the surveillance dint get to. and we should see a spike of cases in a few weeks.\nOnce it gets hold it can quickly overwhelm the poorer sections of society which cannot afford the costlier private health care hospitals and those without good insurance. The government public hospital cannot handle this load.\n\nThe only silver lining is that studies conducted for H1N1 , Flu and SARS corona strains have shown that the Indian summer effectively stops droplet based contamination as the extreme temperatures will kill the virus once it's outside the host.

Given that high IV doses of Vitamin C have been proven in the past to be an effective antiviral agent, why isn't this more talked about and implemented everywhere? \n\nI received the newsletter below from Orthomolecular medicine:\n\n(OMNS Mar 3, 2020) *The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C*. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.\n\nThese dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, \"Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.\"\n\nRichard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.\nDr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.\n\nAn official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:\n\n\"On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).\"", "created_utc": 1583431517, "complete": true, "id": "fjkptfg", "link_id": "t3_fcjba4"}]
