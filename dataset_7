Utilize the truth herein to stay focused on manifesting a greater reality. We are not alone, seek the tools given to us via our evolutionary process. \nHi everyone. Here is a great message from Dr. Bruce Lipton, a Ph.D in microbiology, and the father of epigenetics. Lee Carroll \n\u2014\u2014\nMarch 10, 2020\n \nDear Family of Love and Seekers Everywhere,\n \nCoronavirus: Do Not Fear the Bogeyman\n \nThe world is currently gripped in fear of the scary coronavirus.  Let\u2019s first get one fact clear: If you have ever had a cold or flu in your life, odds are that it was the result of a coronavirus infection. Yes, coronaviruses cause colds.\n \nBut, we are being programmed with the belief that this particular cold virus is \u201cdeadly.\u201d This fear has shut down concerts, conferences, and major public events all over the world. The fear has led to quarantines and closing down of international travel. It has even led to a major scarcity of toilet paper in Australia, were concerned citizens emptied the shelves of this commodity in anticipation that they will be walled up in their homes with this infection.\n \nFirst, how deadly is this version of the virus? Yes, there have been corona-related deaths reported with initial statistics suggesting that ~2+% of the infected population dies. Wow! That number is almost 1% more deaths than are attributed to any conventional flu the world experiences (Note: Percentage of flu deaths is based on world population. However, each country has its own statistics, for example in the US the flu death rate is about 0.1%, while less developed countries may have up to ~1% mortality). Additionally, the percentage of covid-19 mortality is inflated since many infected patients with mild symptoms are not reported* (see article attached below). What is misleading is the fear that everyone who carries this virus may die from their cold. This is simply untrue! The health of almost all the covid-19 victims was already compromised before they were infected.\n \nFor example, the following information was provided by the news in regard to the 6 patients that died of the virus in the state of Washington last week (I added the bold print):\nWashington State\nSix people have died in Washington and health officials have identified 18 cases.\nFour of the cases in King County were linked to the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland. More than 50 residents and staff at the facility are being tested.\nThe deaths announced Monday, according to health officials, included:\n-A male in his 70s, who lived at LifeCare. He had underlying health conditions and died Sunday.\n-A female resident of LifeCare in her 70s. She also had underlying health conditions and died Sunday.\n-A woman in her 80s, who was already reported as in critical condition at EvergreenHealth, died Sunday.\nA Snohomish County resident at EvergreenHealth also died but details of that patient have not been given.\nTwo previously reported deaths included a man in his 70s who had underlying health conditions and had been a resident of LifeCare. He died at EvergreenHealth on Feb. 29. The other was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. He was admitted with serious respiratory issues and tested positive for the virus. He died at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland.\nAs emphasized in this report, the health of all those that died with the coronavirus was already compromised. Healthy people get cold and flu symptoms, while those already sick and near death\u2019s door may experience the \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d when infected by the virus. True, sick people are more vulnerable to the virus; healthy people really have nothing to fear.\n \nAs presented in The Biology of Belief, stress is responsible for up to 90% of illness, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes. When an individual is in stress, the release of stress hormones (e.g., cortisol) shuts down the immune system to conserve the body\u2019s energy for running away from the perceived stressor, that proverbial \u201csaber-toothed tiger.\u201d Stress hormones are so effective at compromising the immune system, that physicians therapeutically provide recipients of organ transplants with stress hormones to prevent their immune system from rejecting the foreign implant.\n \nThe conclusion is clear: The fear of the coronavirus is more deadly than the virus itself!\n \nThe media (perhaps in conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry) is compromising people\u2019s health using the fear card! This is the result of negative thinking (the nocebo effect) which is the complete opposite of the placebo effect manifest through positive thinking! If you make efforts to stay healthy, with good nutrition, exercise, taking vitamins and supplements, and more importantly, avoiding stress (e.g., the \u201cfear\u201d of the virus), even if you do get infected with the virus, you will likely only end up with a cold and/or slight fever.\n \nIf you are someone with a compromised immune system, it is supportive to surround yourself with loving family and friends, nature, and positive thoughts as well as any other nutrition and vitamins that you may already be taking for your health and wellbeing. Following your intuition about what is best for you is key! The point here is that no matter who you are and what your state of health, you will only benefit from steering clear of the fear and supporting yourself in whatever way feels best to you. \n \nPlease remember the truth of quantum physics, the most valid of all sciences on the planet: Consciousness is creating your life experiences! Are you being conscious of disease \u2026 or of health? Wishing you all Health, Happiness and Harmdirector-general and. Light,\nBruce\n \nFrom the The Guardian (newspaper in England, March 11, 2020): What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?\nIt is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying the bout, but the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, talked of 3.4%, but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases. We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted, which would bring the mortality rate significantly down.\nDeaths are highest in the elderly, with very low rates among younger people, although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to a lot of viruses are thought to be more at risk. But even among the over-80s, 90% will recover.", "id": "fkg3de8"}, {"subreddit": "nCoV", "author": "IIWIIM8", "link_id": "t3_f8gxd8", "parent_id": "t3_f8gxd8", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1582496276, "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "pessimism": false, "optimism": false, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": false, "disgust": false, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "***Tranlstion:***\n\n**500 passengers are stuck at the Brenner - train traffic stopped**\n\noe24-EXKLUSIV: According to security circles, a train with two suspected coronavirus cases was stopped on board at the Brenner border - shortly afterwards, train traffic between Austria and Italy was discontinued.\nTirol.

I was a bit hurt and that came out. So, I\u2019ll use this opportunity to say, I\u2019m Sorry Chris, for saying something immature like that.\n\nNow I will give you the opportunity as well to apologize to me for claiming I require mental help and then saying I have self confidence issues.\n\nAt the end of the day, nationality doesn\u2019t matter as this affects the entire world.

You're right that the source may not be as credible as most here- but even broken clocks can be right twice a day. There is absolutely no evidence this us infant a bioweapon other than conjecture and speculation however the caveat being we technically do not know the source of the virus so it is impossible to say \"no its not\" and be anymore truthful than \"yes it is\". It seems more likely, imo, that as a majority of scientist have agreed this is a natural zoonotic virus that has been present in the environment for some time now , while jumping back and forth between different species. It is also likely according to studies that this is not the firs time this virus has made the jump to humans \n\nBecause it is already so well adapted to a human host, most likely it has made one or several previous jumps from animal species [most likely a combination of bats, pangolins, and civets or ferrets] to humans- but not been able to sustain h2h transmission. Or at the very least if it has sustained h2h in the past it did so only in a small area that went unnoticed and then died off. In this scenario, This just happens to be the one mutation that made it infectious enough to have sustained community transmission, and the reason for the spread. That said- we while we have multiple studies *suggesting* that, it still is not 100% definitive and is just speculation.\n\nThis virus continues to show, even.by virologist standards, that this virus is indeed pretty unique in quite a few different ways. It was also stated very early on by epidemiologist on scene that while this outbreak started in relation to the Wuhan wet market, it was undeniable that \"the virus walked into that market first\". Some take this as proof it's some sort of weapon- I just add it to the long list of information concurring with the previous paragraph.  \n\nThe physical relation to the bio lab, the ambiguous origin, and its uniqueness naturally are going to inspire some odd theories - and they have. The problem comes - like with most of be he says we have- from the fact that we know so little for 100% certain. Which is why we allow speculation on all of those theories because until we have definitive proof  it's impossible to 100%accurately say. \n\nThat said- because we allow almost all sources in this sub and acknowledge the problems with telling fact from speculation - I've tried to be as thorough as possible in our [\"1* Rule\"  &amp; Guidelines here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cvnews/comments/eyvvot/welcome_to_rcvnews_your_source_for_the_latest/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) which describes all of their flairs and their meanings.

The criteria for those flairs is more specific when it comes to verified sources. \"Unofficial youtube accounts \", \"social media\", \"op-eds\" and \"discussion \" threads we recommend using your best judgement and a little extra scrutiny.

Lam estimated that more overseas Hongkongers are likely to return to the city in the following one or two weeks. \n\nAs an international hub as well as an important gateway to the Chinese mainland, the risk Hong Kong faces is also passed on to the mainland. \n\nHowever, although most places in the mainland announced strict measures to prevent and control imported cases, arrivals from are seemingly receiving special treatment, which, some analysts warned, would probably create loopholes on the mainland's anti-pandemic mechanism and trigger a second wave of the outbreak.      \n\nA Hong Kong resident surnamed Liu working in Beijing told the Global Times he was directly allowed entry into Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, when returning from Malaysia, on Wednesday. \n\nThe Guangzhou customs simply screened his temperature before issuing him health quarantine approval, which stated \"the passenger has passed quarantine procedure,\" according to Liu.  \n\nGuangzhou authority requires arrivals from 19 pandemic-affected countries and regions, including Malaysia, to undergo 14-day quarantine starting Friday. \n\nThe province updated its prevention policies Saturday, making it mandatory for arrivals through Hong Kong to undergo quarantine for 14 days; however, it did not give a clear explanation on how they would deal with those heading to other provinces and regions in the mainland. \n\nAnalysts said the move indicates Guangdong is seeking a way to divert pressure as too many international arrivals come to the province every day requiring quarantine, but by allowing travelers, like Liu, to proceed to other regions, loopholes are left unchecked\n\nHong Kong has different testing standards to that of the mainland. People entering the mainland from the city should not be exempted from concentrated quarantine amid the dangerous trend of the recent surge in cases in Hong Kong, they noted.\n\nWhile Hong Kong witnessed the biggest single-day jump in new cases, the Chinese mainland has reported zero domestic cases of infection for the third consecutive,  media reported Saturday. All the new cases reported recently in the mainland are imported cases and the number of such cases on Friday reached 41. Most of these travelers, confirmed with COVID-19, entered the mainland via Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong.  \n\nThe aforementioned traveler, Liu, flew to Beijing on Thursday from Guangzhou, thus bypassing the screening procedure in the Chinese capital for international arrivals. He was refused admission to a Beijing hotel for self-quarantine as he did not have a mainland ID number. \n\nHe finally found a designated hotel for quarantine, after accessing a list of such  hotels that he obtained from his residential community in Beijing.\n\nSimilar instances have been reported in Shanghai and Shenzhen, another important gateway to the mainland in Guangdong, adjoining Hong Kong. \n\nAccording to media reports, Shenzhen authorities issue a direct pass to arrivals from Hong Kong if they claim they have not been abroad in the past 14 days. \n\nIt is time to bring Hong Kong under the ambit of the mandatory quarantine policies, some analysts urged. \n\nLocal governments, which are authorized to frame specific quarantine policies, should put aside the consideration from a political perspective, and act at the earliest so the Chinese mainland's hard-earned achievements in the anti-pandemic fight thrive, analysts said. \n\n\"It has come to a time that we have to do this. Any possible loophole must be plugged and this is the base for us to sustain cross-border traffic,\" they noted.  \n\nSome experts also suggest strengthened cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong to ward off imported infection risks. The Hong Kong regional government itself may not be able to handle the prevention work associated with the huge influx of international visitors and returnees that is looming large. It needs to cooperate with Shenzhen to jointly manage the situation, they said.\n\nAfter Hong Kong's mandatory 14-day quarantine policy for international arrivals came into force on Friday, some mainland residents who planned to return home via Hong Kong have sought help on social media platforms, as they are afraid they would not be allowed to leave Hong Kong upon arrival. \n\nAccording to media reports, Hong Kong authorities would probably deny boarding to passengers who try to reach the mainland via Hong Kong unless they are taking a connecting flight, which means they would not leave the transit zone after disembarking at the Hong Kong airport. \n\nSimilarly, several Shenzhen locals who planned to return home via the Shenzhen Bay Checkpoint could not leave the airport and pass the checkpoint as predicted. They had to fly to Shanghai or Beijing and transfer for Shenzhen, which further raises the risk of infection. \n\nDespite concerns and risks, some epidemiologists are confident of the anti-pandemic battle due to sufficient internal cooperation between the mainland cities and the Hong Kong SAR.   \n\nHong Kong and the mainland have maintained an efficient exchange of data and information on the epidemic, taken unified actions and established joint prevention and control mechanisms, which have been maintained well in previous outbreaks, including SARS in 2003, Yang Gonghuan,  a former vice director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times Saturday.\n\n\"If the situation in Hong Kong worsens, the mainland will take emergency measures as soon as possible.\"", "id": "fldvhxr"}, {"subreddit": "worldnews", "author": "CDWEBI", "link_id": "t3_fo4hb8", "parent_id": "t1_fldorpz", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1585071905, "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "pessimism": false, "optimism": false, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": false, "disgust": false, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "&gt; China is willing to play the long game, but is Xi willing to die without Taiwan reintegrated if he has a shot at it?\n\nYes.

If Xi's actions are too much against the party, he will suddenly \"willingly\" step down. And whether China will go to war against Taiwan will certainly not be decided by only Xi, but the party.\n\n&gt; I don't expect them to make a move, but it's more likely now than ever before.\n\nTrue, but China has now some economic problems, the sudden trade war plus the corona virus.

The phrase, often punctuated with \u201cbro,\u201d has become a sort of shorthand among some members who use it as a derisive caricature of what they feel is a dangerously ignorant attitude toward the severity of the newly emerging coronavirus pandemic. Members of the sub often have bitter debates about the flu comparison with comments on the one hand sharing statistics about the thousands of flu deaths that occur in the United States every year, and comments on the other hand raising the alarm about the novel coronavirus\u2019 currently estimated mortality rate of a little over 2%, which in theory, some of the sub\u2019s redditors claim, could kill millions in a serious pandemic.\u00a0\n\n\nThe comparison of COVID-19 to the seasonal flu is popular in the mainstream media recently, with one redditor saying that they had witnessed a lengthy conversation about the flu on the TV network CNN. Many other members shared articles they had encountered expounding on the flu theme. Redditors claiming to work in the healthcare industry even said they had encountered it as a patronizing dismissal of their concern about the new coronavirus. Many contributors to r/Coronavirus, however, feel strongly that this conversation is a waste of precious time. They believe that COVID-19 is something to take more seriously than seasonal flu. They point out the extreme measures that China has gone to in order to contain the virus, quarantining a majority of their billion citizens - an event unprecedented in human history. They ask why China needed to build dozens of new hospitals in a matter of weeks, apparently frantically racing to add tens of thousands of hospital beds in the city of Wuhan in central China. They are skeptical that China would react this way if the virus were only as significant as a common flu.\n\n\nThose who fear the worst are commonly mocked by their fellow redditors. The most vicious ridicule is reserved for those who are actually preparing their families for a possible worst case scenario, dubbed \u201cpreppers\u201d in the world of reddit and lampooned as paranoid survivalists and alarmists. What is it that all these internet users are so afraid of? What seems to frighten them even more than the high mortality rate (which, ironically, appears to be quite possibly as lethal as the infamous virus that caused the 1918 influenza epidemic that killed 50 to 100 million people a century ago) are reports of the high hospitalization rate for those who catch the extremely contagious new virus which has put as many as 20% of its sufferers in the hospital - many of whom need intense care and spend weeks in the hospital. According to many posts shared on r/Coronavirus, the healthcare system in Wuhan was overwhelmed by coronavirus infection victims who needed acute respiratory care. Many redditors on r/Coronavirus believe the allegations they have seen of blindsighted hospitals in Wuhan forced to turn sick and dying patients away to fend for themselves. They are worried that what might have happened in Wuhan could happen in any city. They are furious with a talking point they see as a fatal delay to the inevitable conversation they feel we must have about a lethal pandemic that is already under way.\n\n\nWith Health officials around the world, including those at the CDC and the FDA, publicly saying that the virus will probably continue to spread rapidly throughout the world - there is one thing that every member of r/Coronavirus agrees on: they hope the \u201cpreppers\u201d are wrong.", "id": "fiyj23o"}, {"subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "GustavVA", "link_id": "t3_fgge6w", "parent_id": "t1_fk4gpqi", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1583865317, "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": true, "pessimism": true, "optimism": true, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": false, "disgust": false, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "US News released an article citing an estimate of about 9000 cases (true numbers) early in the week.

They might actually lose even more than that, or they might have actually lose less than that. A lot of the money they thought they would have, was based on transactions that may or may or may not take place now that this has occurred.\n\nA side effect of this, is that many companies are now not worth today what they were worth yesterday. This may cause fears that investment in the company is no longer good, and people may stop their investment in the company, and put the money in something safer, like a commodity, or stock in a more recession proof industry. If that happens, it will harder for businesses to get capital to make things happen and grow and make more money.\n\nAt the same time, the fears could be unfounded. We may soon find out that things are actually more okay than they seemed today, and that businesses are actually going to go through with all that good moneymaking they thought they would. If that's the case, the stocks will rebound pretty soon.\n\nSince the stock market was at an all time high, and probably due for a \"correction\" sometime soon, it is sort of likely that this could cause a recession, like in the first case. By correction, I mean that although the market always grows, as there are more people and more things happening, when it consistently grows for a long time, you can assume that some of the \"value\" is overestimated. People are assuming it will keep growing at a similar rate, so they add their money to the pot. A correction is when everybody realizes there's kind of a \"bubble\" of investment, and maybe things aren't worth what they're selling for.\n\nThe market can also correct because people realize that the fears that are taking people out of the market, or making them figure things are worth less, are unfounded, and that actually things are more okay than they seem.\n\nAll of this falls down to a sort of time-money conundrum. In the long run, it doesn't really matter, things are just going to be worth what they were worth. In the short term, it can very important.

We know that an awful lot of people are infected and that hospitals in the region of Bergamo are full. We also know that it is not a normal flu, it does different things to your body. The difference is that we have known the flu for hundreds of years. This corona virus is new, and therefore more impactful. But is it more dangerous than the flu was in the beginning (before remedy was available)? I wouldn't dare to say that.\n\nAlso, this text is full of **war language** 'war', 'dramatic', 'tsunami'. It seems quite emotionally written to me. If you read carefully, it does say that to young people \"Covid 19 causes a banal flu\". So yeah, it mainly affects people 65+. Did you know that Italy has a large elderly population in comparison to other countries? This is one of the reasons that there are many deaths in Italy already.\n\nIf you are a young person, then you should be fine. In worst case you might end up in the hospital, but the chances of dying (even if you are 65 years old) are really small.

Not just professional creed.    \n\n2. **pay for the fire fighting:** immediately announce to all citizens that the tests (both positive and negative) and treatment are completely covered by the country. You will suffer much more economic loss if you don't do this. One of the highest medical bills covered in China is 80,000 USD for a recovered patient who has used the ECMO and other treatment. This amount of money can buy you a two-bedroom apartment in a small city in China.

This is because the Chinese doctors have found if you keep those confirmed at home for self-quarantine, they can infect their families no matter how careful their carers are so the R0 will rise, and these mild symptom patients were more likely to escalate into a severe symptom that requires immediate medical intervention,  and the further logistic will delay the urgently need treatment. ; for those with severe symptoms (that means those that need a ventilator right away) and those above 65 that has other severe diseases (co-morbidity), they are sent to the remodelled specialised ward immediately for critically needed hospital.   \n\n4. **turn on the fire alarm**: for better-educated crowds, provide data through timely publication in journal articles and science reports; for average civilians, use any catchy, short slogans to make the public understand the severity of the situation -- at italy, they use  \"either casa or coffin\" for Chinese villages, it is like \"If you let your neighbours visit you today, they will visit you at your graveyard\"  I think in the US, the talk show hosts can really help in this situation.    \n\n5. **Last, morale**\n\n like the Hollywood movies where the turning point is always a president gave a speech then the war is turned, you really need this. probably not a \"natural ability\" speech though.    \n\n**6. Maybe, asking for help**\n\nasking for help when needed when masks and protective gears are in critical need, Japan, Korea, Pakistan and many other countries helped China through the early phase. The Chinese never forgot those. So when now China's daily production of n95 and surgical masks have reached 100 million per day, the Chinese government turned to donate a lot to those countries that have offered help. There is a mutual misunderstanding between the US and China,  but there are also strong ties between the two, historically, economically and on many civilian levels too. There was Korean war, but there was also the Flying Tigers legacy that are still greatly respected in China. Instead of using this epidemic to continue to brag about bring back production to the US in a globalisation age, maybe it does not hurt to ask for help.   \n\nLove from China. even though there are trade wars and papers mocking the Chinese,  we live on the same planet, and covid-19 is a common enemy.", "id": "fk6b8rj"}, {"subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "VisualBen", "link_id": "t3_erj61t", "parent_id": "t3_erj61t", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1579714920, "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "pessimism": false, "optimism": false, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": false, "disgust": false, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "Here\u2019s how the Corona Virus \ud83e\udda0 can kill you \u2198\ufe0f READ.

It's a Saturday and I finally have some time to contribute. Was planning on posting this awhile back but couldn't find the time. There's a wealth of information on the research side that I need to attend to. Anyways, here's a mini primer on the whole situation with some of my insights. For the most part, I've noticed that discussion on Reddit concerning the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be on point, scientifically. Aside from the occasional fear mongering, misinformation, anti-China sentiment, and jokes about Plague Inc, I feel like general knowledge (at least on Reddit) on the epidemic is pretty decent which is always nice to see. Of note, there is research done on social media during these disease outbreaks (2009 pandemic etc). Your comments may end up being used in a study that influences public health policy. \n\n\nFor further questions, please visit the askscience [megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/). For some reason, they don't default sort by \"new\" which I think would be most helpful to the general public. It's flooded with questions. Another thing: *There's no such thing as a stupid question, just a stupid answer.* Please *do* ask if you're worried or unsure. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What do you need to know?**\n\n\nAs of 23:59 on Jan 24, there are officially:\n\n\n**1287** confirmed cases in China across **29** provinces\n\n\n**1965** suspected cases reported in 20 provinces\n\n\n**41** deaths and **237** are severe cases. 39/41 deaths occurred in Hubei province (where Wuhan is located) with 1 death in Hubei province and 1 in Heilongjiang province\n\n\n* 17 deaths range from 48-89 years old. **14/17** deaths are of the elderly above 65 years of age. Most have pre-existing conditions that seem to predispose to a more severe disease presentation. People who are already sick prior to infection may be more at risk due to decreased immunity. Some of these people had hypertension, diabetes, and Parkinson's. Death was typically the result of severe respiratory failure but includes others like multi-organ failure. Information on the remaining 8 deaths is currently unknown.\n\n* There are people who have recovered: will update post\n\n\n**28** exported cases: Thailand (4), Taiwan/Singapore (3 each), Hong Kong (5), USA/Japan/South Korea//Vietnam/France/Macau (2 each), Nepal (1)\n\n#Please refer to the live tracker via JHU (below) for an idea of the most current situation\n\n**Initial symptoms**\n\n\n* cough\n* fever (pyrexia possible absence in young individuals)\n* fatigue, discomfort (malaise), shortness of breath (dyspnea), dizziness, chest tightness, headache, muscle aches, chills, sore throat\n* possible atypical presentations in immunosuppressed/elderly.\n\n\nStandard evaluation involves evaluating clinical features of 2019-nCoV with epidemiological risk (travel history/exposure history). However in Wuhan, I question if this is the case. Physicians likely are referring directly to the hospital putting a huge strain on resources. \n\n\n**Rough Timeline of Some Key Events (will update if time allows)**\n\n\n* **Dec 8th:** Earliest known patient with symptom onset\n* **Dec 24th:** Collection of genomic sequence based on atypical pneumonia\n* **Dec 31st:** WHO notified\n* **Jan 1st:** Closure of wet market\n* **Jan 8thth:** Novel coronavirus identified\n* **Jan 10th:** Professor Yong-Zhen Zhang (Shanghai) releases genome\n* **Jan 11th:** First fatality\n* **Jan 12th:** Sequenced genome deposited on GenBank. A genome is like the blueprint for living things. Viruses may/may not be \"living\" but I digress..\n* **Jan 13th:** First exported case in Thailand\n* **Jan 19th:** First diagnostic test \n* **Jan 20th:** Human-Human transmission confirmed\n* **Jan 23rd:** CEPI funding of vaccine development, quarantine begins\n* **Present/Onwards:** Vaccine, Antigen/Antibody testing, animal modeling, identification of reservoir, further\n\n**What some things healthcare professionals are doing or will be doing?**\n\n* Largest quarantine in the history of public health (**8** cities: with a combined population ~30 million). Cities: Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Xiantao, Qianjiang, Zhijiang, and Lichuan.\n* Diagnostic testing: Molecular diagnostics, cell culture, microscopy, Antigen/Antibody detection\n* Genomic analyses\n* mRNA vaccine development\n* Preparation of animal modeling\n* Investigations into\n\n**Some other notes**\n\n* Very much can change in a very short amount of time. Healthcare workers are very likely overwhelmed in Wuhan. Physicians may be working non-stop despite the period of celebration for the Lunar New Year\n\n\n* There's speculation that China may be voluntarily hiding how much people are infected/deceased. It's possible but in my opinion not likely. Hospitals are likely overrun with people presenting even the mildest flu-like symptoms. There is delay due to the spectrum of illness and degree of asymptomatic spread among other factors\n\n\n* China does deserve some credit. If you compare the timeline with the SARS outbreak, we are doing *way* better (availability of data, transparency, measures of control, research etc). I remember laying in bed and jumping up when I was notified that the preliminary complete genome was available. I was excited.\n\n* As expected, there are new strains as the virus infects new populations. As it jumps from host to host, it potentially \"arms\" itself for more efficient transmission. There are 26 genomes publicly available.\n\n\n* Please note that we are still in the *very* early stages with preliminary data only giving us a rough idea of what to expect. We do **not** know the natural host and whether there are intermediate amplification hosts. With SARS, it was bats -&gt; palmed civet -&gt; humans.\n\n\n* Preliminary data suggests that the zoonotic event (animal to human event) happened recently. There is very low diversity between sequenced genomes.\n\n\n* Preliminary data (compared to SARS) shows mutations in the surface proteins needed to bind human cells and a relatively conserved protease. The virus makes a big protein that gets chopped up with this protease in order to replicate. \n\n\n* I also want to stress that it is quite easy to sit behind a screen and throw blame around. Granted there are certain contributing factors leading to this outbreak but in my opinion, there is a time to address those. At the moment, there needs to be a focus on containment and research.

Not specific to coronavirus or any epidemic testing, but I had to report a couple of test results to the CDC and state department of health. Both were for diseases that had to be reported to the department of health for our state and to the CDC. There is not good communication between the two bodies (or any government agencies).\n\nThe testing was done by a private laboratory using CDC approved methods, but they still had to individually test and confirm the results. I believe our department of health accepted our results as they were presented and didn't do a lot of follow up, since the patient was from out of state and I'm pretty sure they were already dead. Anyways, states don't necessarily have the same standards for testing and resulting that the CDC does. They're far more likely to accept results from private laboratories with minimal follow up.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC is located in Atlanta. That means any suspected cases have to have samples mailed to Atlanta for follow up testing to be an \"official\" confirmed CDC case. It's a very messy system and really not a great one for a disease causing mass panic.\n\nTL;DR Kind of, the CDC has to test and confirm all suspected cases and does not accept results from private laboratories. Since a lot of state DOH *do* accept results from private laboratories, it complicates how many confirmed cases the CDC has. Also, I suspect that a lot of people who probably have coronavirus aren't being tested since most cases are very mild.\n\nETA: the disease we tested for was plague, which is very rare, but still has to be reported to the CDC", "id": "fjidldd"}, {"subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "Groot746", "link_id": "t3_fifkj4", "parent_id": "t3_fifkj4", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1584189444, "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "pessimism": true, "optimism": false, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": false, "disgust": true, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "So based on everything I've read, the government's approach seems to be what I am going to call the Lord Farquaad strategy: \"some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice that I am willing to make\"). It presupposes that a high proportion of us will inevitably contract the virus (estimates range from 60% to 80%), that many will die, but that many of us will then develop an immunity that will prevent us infecting others in the future. Incidentally, this strategy wasn't even supported by a majority of the government's own scientific advisers (https://twitter.com/peterjukes/status/1238616245978763264). It also leaves us completely defenceless if the two currently unproven assumptions that people who have been infected and survived are now completely immune from contracting it again/infecting others, and that the virus won't mutate at all (there are many different strains of the flu, for example.).\n\nThe other problem with this strategy, however, is that it has not been coupled with comprehensive information/advice on protecting more vulnerable people through strategies like social distancing, e.g. the elderly and those with underlying health conditions: indeed, it almost seems that a lack of information is a deliberate choice to ensure that the virus does spread more rapidly, and achieve the theorised \"herd immunity\" situation quicker. \n\nTo ask people to support a strategy that accepts an \"acceptable\" level of deaths, without even the pretence of looking like they are trying to minimise unnecessary deaths of the most elderly/vulnerable, naturally gives many of us no confidence at all that this government cares about protecting its own citizens. This is why we are seeing people taking matters into their own hands, with events being cancelled/the Premier League being suspended etc., and why the government are now scrambling to adapt to people ignoring them and doing what they like.\n\nMore widely, this situation demonstrates that having a high level of social solidarity, high levels of trust in our own government and the experts that it chooses to listen to, and a willingness to believe their narratives would be extremely beneficial in a public health crisis like this, which requires people to voluntarily change their own behaviour. And even taking my own biases out as much as I can, the life and career of Boris Johnson up to now does not suggest that the current prime minister is somebody that has ever taken an active interest in putting other people's lives first, or someone with any interest in telling hard truths when necessary: indeed, he's been literally sacked from jobs in two different professions (journalism and politics) for continuously lying, and failing to take responsibility for anything. So is it any wonder that we don't trust him now to effectively and compassionately lead a high-risk strategy with very little scientific basis?\n\nSo far as I can see, this approach reeks of the decisions of people who feel nothing when people they don't know die, and whom are willing to accept a high number of deaths just to see if their strategy works: it is out of step with how the entire rest of the world is approaching things, it is based on very fragile scientific hypotheses without a solid evidence base, and it is taking a huge gamble with our lives without giving us any solid justification as to why it has been chosen as the way to combat coronavirus.", "id": "fkh5n6e"}, {"subreddit": "worldnews", "author": "Lusterkx2", "link_id": "t3_fl0g8f", "parent_id": "t1_fkvy8x0", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1584599668, "emotion": {"anger": true, "anticipation": false, "pessimism": true, "optimism": false, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": false, "disgust": true, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "You are absolutely right.

Late in the week, though, many joined the shutdown trend.\n\nBy Thursday, the beach in Fort Lauderdale was eerily empty, save for stacked chairs and lifeguard towers. A cluster of college students with roller bags and floppy straw hats walked toward a waiting SUV headed to the airport.\n\nNot all beachgoers were young people. A retired doctor and self-described \u201cmetal detectorist\u201d named Larry Leguire, 68, from Columbus, Ohio, had been in Florida since December. On Thursday on Clearwater Beach, he found four rings, two of which he believed were gold, plus a handful of coins, aluminum cans, pull tabs and bottle caps.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy out here yesterday,\u201d Mr. Leguire said. \u201cYou saw it, right? Today is a lot less. I think it\u2019s the coronavirus and the news about all the kids congregating.\u201d\n\nMr. Leguire said he and his wife keep distance from others and wear gloves and masks in grocery stores. He was not happy to learn that the beach was closing Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe beach is my life, and without the beach, it\u2019s like, why be in Florida?\u201d he said. \u201cI might as well go back home and sequester myself in my house in Columbus, Ohio.\u201d\n\nFormal gatherings like funerals and weddings were canceled or reconsidered. At a backyard wedding near Anaheim, Calif., on Saturday night, a DJ named Amanda B. was so nervous about performing that she did not shake the groom\u2019s hand or let anyone touch her microphone.\n\n\u201cAt that point, the advice was that gatherings of 50 or less were OK,\u201d she said a few days later. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t do it now.\u201d\n\nIn Brooklyn, Hasidic Jews defied isolation orders and held weddings; others continued gathering for prayer. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a wedding planned for late March was expedited and shrunk. Charlotte Jay and Blake Parker, both 29, called their rabbi, invited a dozen close relatives to Mr. Parker\u2019s parents\u2019 condo, and rushed to get ready.\n\nClorox wipes and hand sanitizer greeted guests on an outdoor terrace. Mr. Parker\u2019s mother played the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d on her cellphone. The wedding planner live-streamed the ceremony for the original 225 guests.\n\n\u201cMy dad and I sanitized our hands, linked arms and walked down the aisle,\u201d Ms. Jay said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even hug or kiss. My dad elbow bumps Blake. Then he elbow bumps me.\u201d\n\nOthers tried to treat these as normal times, though contrasts were easy to spot. California\u2019s Santa Monica Pier was closed, its amusement park quiet and still, but surfers continued riding waves below it.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon in Los Angeles\u2019 Fairfax District, groups of runners dripped sweat on the near empty streets, zooming past day laborers humming corridos. At the Erewhon market a mile away, both the middle-aged and millennials sipped to-go coffees and munched plates of roasted organic carrots and beets at clusters of outdoor tables.\n\nAt nearby Pan Pacific Park, basketball players filled a court and CrossFitters heaved kettlebells on the grass. It seemed more leisurely Sunday than mounting global emergency.\n\nAmong the unexpected places to see a virus-induced surge in visitors were some national parks. Big Bend National Park, in Texas, had lines of cars a week ago and was \u201cpacked\u201d earlier this week, even as isolation orders rolled across the country.\n\nMost national parks waived entrance fees but closed visitors centers. Yosemite National Park was among those to shut down lodging, and on Friday afternoon, closed entirely.\n\nOn Saturday, people in the Bay Area ignored stay-in-place orders and crowded outdoor places like the Marin Headlands and Point Reyes National Seashore, which reported \u201cunprecedented visitation.\u201d\n\nAny type of middle-of-nowhere congregation created a new kind of worry \u2014 rural areas with limited medical facilities being overrun with tourists just as the pandemic strikes in full. That concern shut down Colorado ski resorts. Islands in Maine and North Carolina barred visitors.\n\nIn Moab, Utah, an area known for rock climbing and mountain biking near Arches National Park, health officials shut down hotels to everyone but local residents or those traveling for work after executives from the 17-bed Moab Regional Hospital implored the state to help.\n\nThat was the concern in Bishop. The Bishop Area Climbers Coalition ultimately asked \u201cclimbing friends\u201d to \u201cnot travel to Bishop at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried about what will happen if and when Bishop turns into its own little cluster\u201d of the coronavirus, Deikis, the coalition\u2019s vice president, said on Wednesday.\n\nBy Friday, after shops had closed and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California gave a shelter-in-place order, the town was relatively quiet again.\n\nThere was no outrunning the effects of the coronavirus, even at the edge of the continent. In Key West, Fla., a red, black and yellow buoy marking the southernmost point in the continental United States is a hot spot for tourists. A line forms every day, all day, for the photo op in front of the buoy that declares \u201c90 Miles to Cuba.\u201d\n\nThe buoy was covered this week in a quest to keep tourists from gathering there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the southernmost tarp!\u201d one tourist quipped.\n\nKay Seeling, 69, and two friends made the trip to Florida from Seattle a week ago, not expecting the crisis to follow them, exploding as it did. Now they had few options, as bars and many restaurants closed, and county officials ordered hotels closed by Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking precautions,\u201d Denise Algie, a companion, said, noting her hand sanitizer.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not,\u201d Ms. Seeling argued. \u201cWe have masks, but we\u2019re not wearing them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to die of something at our age anyway,\u201d Ms. Algie said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop life.\u201d\n\nThey hopped on their rented golf cart and left.

I will try converting it into a philosophical discussion.\n\n First, how the pride of the objectively more educated and more morally good make them look down at the objectively lesser-educated and less-good in a crisis like this, to the point where the educated/good find the act of \"looking down at others\" a form of entertainment (Just like in this and many other subreddits, not to mention human social groups in general), causing the sensationalization of information about the crisis for the \"educated\", giving them a caricatured, what some might call \"de-humanizing\", view of the \"fools\" and \"villians\" as they win their \"darwin awards\" and \"get hit by karma\". Morally speaking, could these acts of looking down be, and is considered by some, wrong? \n\nSame goes for those who are objectively less intelligent and less good (If there is such as \"objectively\" thing) in this crisis. These people are \"damned to be fools\" and \"damned to be evil\". Their \"foolishness\" and \"evilness\" of these people exist with more \"bad\" group of parts \"in\" them (stupidity, greed, uncaring) to differentiate from the rest that have less bad parts by fact of being and have more good parts (Intelligence, generosity, kind) by fact of being, the same way dogs are cute to some by \"fact of being\", and spiders are scary to some by \"fact of being.\" Do they deserve the damage from a crisis because they *are* fools or *are* evil, and mentally discard them because they deserved it? Or do we pity, mentally suffer with their material suffering, as they are damned, due to said lack of intellect, to suffer, and we should bare their foolishness due to being kin?\n\n Should the ones who get well off both in the physical world and the metaphysical one (Like somebody doomed to die, but is a whistleblower of coronavirus) from coronavirus crisis feel superiority over others in this crisis, just because they are \"Democrat Hoax!\" republicans, a Theocratic Iranian leader, or a \"bat-eating brainwashed\" CCP member? I bring to question to the habit of many (possibly all), where we see one who we view as deserving of punishment with joy, but see that of people we love, understand, relate to, have the same nationality/ideologies/internet-website-box etc as undeserving of the punishment they receive, where in fact this \"punisher\"(That is the world and what happens) does not bother with judgement, does whatever it likes, and we apply the words \"deserved\" and \"undeserved\" into the cases on \"the fact of their being\". \n\nAn \"unlucky fool\" who, due to suffering a tragic race-related incident from the past, will forever be a racist trump supporter by \"the fact of his being\". An Islamic revolutionist, who killed many dissenters, because he values his view of his religion and nation over what he thinks are a few regrettable but necessary human lives by \"the fact of his being\". A CCP member, who due to cultural tradition and genuine personal enjoyment of the taste of bats, eats bats daily causing a deadly pandemic by \"the fact of his being\". A dictatorship is a nation that oppresses people \"by the fact of it's being\". Communism is a system that generally doesn't work by \"the fact of it's being\" due to how human nature works \"by the fact of it's being\". Are you seeing what I mean?\n\nTo discard them, means that due to being seeing them in the group of \"evil or stupid\", every harm they suffer is a \"deserved\", making it a fact of their being, which is useful to some people going through this crisis, relieving stress, enforcing superiority of ones objectively better intellect and heart, but makes having to deal with those on their side(Smart people who have taken precautions, good-hearted people, friends, the progressive and leaders of the free world \"West\"\uff09who still suffer from the unjudging eyes of \"the world and what happens\", and make us have to set \"did not deserve it\", \"too good for this world\", \"tragic\" as facts of their being.\n\n  The alternative option is to remove \"deserve\" and \"underserved\" from \"the facts of being\" of all, evil,good, smart and not, where instead we just accept the punishment from \"whatever happens\" itself in a crisis like the coronavirus as the \"fact of being\", thus not giving the individual the usefulness from \"enjoying the punishment of the deserved\", but is more able accept the punishment from the \"undeserving\" better, since neither in this kind of mindset exist, instead it's purely getting punishment from \"the world and what happens\" without judgement\" that is the \"fact of being\", and finding the \"the world and what happens\" tragic that it is like that, a \"fact of being\" of ourselves. Many probably have option one has as the default mindset, and it is understandable since it is useful at times, but I hope some also consider the usefulness of the latter mindset too.\n\n... okay, as I let my hands type this out naturally and finished writing this, I think I might have wrote too much and gone off-topic.

While nobody suggests smoking as a mitigation strategy, and _IF_ smoking has some protective effect, it might might still be worse, because if you get it, you more likely are a severe or dead case. \n\nIf this is actually caused by smoking, the point is that we should find out why, and look if we could use that positive aspect isolated or modified, without the negative ones. If we can't apply it, it would still give us a broader knowledge base and understanding. If it is just some odd sampling bias, also fine, then this is solved, and we need only to check if that bias renders the data invalid or not.

The gov issued the orders, and now has a responsibility to make up the damage caused. I feel the easiest thing there would be the gov offer interests free loans that with some stipulations attached.

Way to totally miss the point on command responsibility and accountability by focusing on Arroyo. I never denied that Arroyo was corrupt Heck she was probably more corrupt than Estrada but you can't deny the fact that Noynoy can only blame her for so much. Arroyo's corrupt but what does that shit have to do with Noynoy being incapable of having command responsibility? A president only has six years. Does he really need to spend the first three blaming the previous administration instead of conducting studies and implementing actual programs to answer the country's needs? On that note, why just focus on investigating the Arroyo administration when all the other administrations should be presumed corrupt? That hostage crisis involving HK tourists? Erap doesn't need to issue an apology, Noynoy does. Two years ago. He would not be apologizing because the State harmed those tourists (as he claimed) but for the ineptitude of those under him to handle the crisis efficiently. \n\n\n2.) Good relative to what? Do we feel any difference? Is the peso that much stronger compared to three years ago? \n\n\n3.) Noynoy has not yet approved a plan to account for the energy needs of Mindanao or to address the intense flooding problem all over the Philippines or a concrete plan for mass transport. He's been in the office for **THREE YEARS**. Don't you think it's about time he stops blaming the previous administration and START OFFERING SOLUTIONS. There have been studies conducted not just by the Arroyo administration but also previous administrations that Noynoy could have had studied by his experts in the first year, see which are feasible and how to minimize if not prevent corruption over these projects. What did he do? He scrapped them all because he thinks they're tainted. [How about this flood control project which we might end up paying damages for because of Aquino?](http://opinion.inquirer.net/34831/aquino-axed-key-flood-control-project-in-2010) It's already his third year so he better have something planned. You can't build infrastructure overnight but at the rate he's going, we won't see anything built by the time his administration ends. \n\n\n4.) To show that he's just as tainted as everyone else. Remember Sen. Estrada's expose about the bonus for convicting Corona? Corruption. See how they twisted the Napoles story to suit their political agenda. Does anyone actually believe that only opposition Senators and Congressmen have made deals with Napoles? \n\nI mentioned Arroyo twice in my earlier comment, in relation to the economic gains Noynoy has been touting and his penchant for blaming her.

''This was real, old-fashioned infectious disease containment,'' she said. ''It all comes back to the same thing, which is stopping infected people from infecting other people.''\n\nAs much as you can, you quarantine people returning from pandemic zone, all the infected people, and all the people in the space the infected people have been in. Quarantine zones have rings inside them and staff of quarantine zone live-in-place until they die-in-place. It sounds heartless, but it works.\n\nThe response from Singapore and Hong Kong governments have been as if they fear economic downturn more than a Wuhan-style pandemic and collapse. The media keep repeating the 2% death rate number. If that was the case, Wuhan wouldn't have been such a mess. The mess shows what can go very wrong very quickly.\n\nFailing that, we go to the standard flu prevention strategy: if you are sick, stay home. If your kids are sick, keep them home. Put a mask on if you are sick and have to go outside. Avoid crowded areas. For at home quarantined people, even if it's just influenza, keep the windows open and ventilate. It reduces the pathogen concentration and prevent more people in your home getting sick.\n\nI am very sorry to say this but Singapore Ministry of Health is acting like complete amateurs. If I ask you right now, as Singaporeans, do you know what should be done if you are quarantining yourself at home? Can you find technical procedures on how to do it properly? Infographics? This is the best I can find, typing \"Home quarantine procedure Singapore\" in to Google: it's a [2009 archive](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/20090511006/moh%20factsheet%20on%20hqo_4%20may%2009.pdf), too.\n\nBy comparison, while the Vietnam Ministry of Health might have lots of problems in other areas and quite frivolous when it comes to a lot of things, but national-security-level pandemics aren't one of them. They act very aggressively. [This](https://haiquanonline.com.vn/bo-y-te-cong-bo-huong-dan-cach-ly-tai-nha-phong-chong-dich-corona-120054.html) is some very nice infographic, albeit in Vietnamese on what to do for at-home-quarantine.\n\nIt defines:\n\n\\- who need to be quarantined and for how long.\n\n\\- Instructions to for quarantined subjects: stay in a separate room and use separate bathroom (failing that, an area at least 2m away from others), keep the room and house well ventilated (no aircon, open windows and doors), measure temperature twice daily, minimize contacts, put on masks and wash hands. Inform designated health worker contacts twice a day on temperature and health status. Inform designated health worker contact upon symptoms: fever, cough, difficulty breathing. Collect trash: mask, tissues, into a closed sealed bag in one corner of the room. Do not eat meals together. \n\n\\- Instruction for housemates of quarantined subjects: wear masks and keep 2m distance, inform designated health workers of symptoms of quarantined subjects, provide masks, hygiene products, soap if needed. Daily cleaning of surfaces (floor, tables, chairs, door handles and knobs) with soap or sanitising solution. Psychological support to quarantined subject during the period. Avoid holding gatherings.\n\nAnd failing that, too, and we end up with influenza infectiousness and SARS or worse lethality. Well, this is the extinction-level event for urban-dwelling humans (*Homo sapien urbani*). It happened a few times in human history already; don't think it will not happen again. So? We spread out, don't live so close to each other. This will take decades and some dead people in between. In the mean time, increase ventilation of all indoor areas. Stagger office hours (for eg, one-third of staff go to work 1 hour early, one-third on time, one-third 1 hour late) so to avoid peak hours on buses and MRTs.

Will rely on cities, businesses, and rely on good sense and good faith to take action to prevent illness  \n-- Dr. Jeff Duchin: for gatherings under 250 attendees, people at risk and elderly are being asked not to attend, period. Social distancing must be kept (stay further away than 6 feet), employees must be screened for symptoms each day and must be excluded if symptomatic. Sanitation must be available. CDC guidelines must be met. Fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat should exclude any employees from working.  \n- What is the county doing to support community clinics?  \n-- Dr. Jeff Duchin: Trying to get healthcare professionals as much info as possible about the virus, ever changing. If ***you don't need to be in a healthcare setting right now, don't go***, this is \"not a good time to visit any healthcare facility if you do not need to be there\" - infection control measures must be taken to prevent spread to other patients but also providers.

The woman attends an out-of-state school and had been studying abroad.\n\nBecause she was starting to feel ill, the woman contacted the St. Louis County Department of Public Health on Thursday, Moore said. She apparently stayed home and did not have contact with anyone until she was instructed on Friday to go to Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur for testing.\n\n\nHospital staff were notified before the woman arrived, so they were able to protect themselves and isolate her from others.\n\nOfficials had said the woman was quarantining herself, along with her parents, who were not showing symptoms. But on Sunday, reports about the father-daughter dance began circulating.\n\n\u201cWe are communicating with the St. Louis County Department of Public Health and sharing everything that we know with them,\" stated Villa Duchesne and Oak Hill communications director Alice Dickherber in an email. \"We will work with officials to ensure we are doing everything possible to mitigate risk and to maintain our safe environment. We are committed to the health and safety of our community and we will follow the guidance of public health officials as we plan for the coming days.\u201d\n\n\nOn Saturday, state and county officials announced the woman\u2019s test result as \u201cpresumptive positive.\u201d The result still needs to be confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which takes a few days. Page said it is \u201chighly likely\u201d the CDC will confirm it.\n\nAmtrak 303\nOn Sunday, Amtrak issued a news release stating that the woman had been on Amtrak train 303. \"Amtrak is notifying passengers and employees who may have been on the same train, and as a precaution, we have taken the train out of service for comprehensive cleaning and disinfection, and are also working to do a thorough disinfection of the Chicago and St. Louis stations,\" the statement read.\n\nThe downtown St. Louis station, called the Gateway Transportation Center, is also a hub for Greyhound, Megabus and Metro St. Louis. \"The Gateway Transportation Center is following guidelines to assure the cleanliness of our facility,\" St. Louis Comptroller Darlene Green's office stated in an email. \n\n\nInvestigators with the county health department spent several hours Saturday interviewing the woman to determine whether she might have had close contact with anyone else who could be at risk.\n\n\u201cWe go through an extensive interviewing process with the person,\u201d that follows CDC protocols, said Spring Schmidt, acting co-director of the county health department. \u201cWe spent several hours with her yesterday going over her movements and travel history \u2026 . It\u2019s a difficult process that requires a lot of careful interviewing and coaching and memory prompts.\u201d\n\nAs investigators learn more, Schmidt said, they are in contact with CDC officials to determine how far back they should document the woman\u2019s movements, who\u2019s at risk of exposure and what other health agencies outside of the county may need to be involved.\n\n\nThe process of determining who needs to be notified, checked for symptoms and tested is unfolding, Schmidt said. Those contacts may lead to more investigations, as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cascading series of potential calls,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until it starts to move forward and it continues to generate potential contact.\u201d\n\nState health department director Dr. Randall Williams was working Sunday alongside county health officials.\n\n\u201cWe are providing extra boots on the ground here. There are a lot of contacts that need to made,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe are looking at her travel schedule, being on trains and planes and staying in hotels, and local contacts.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he wanted to stress that only those in close and prolonged contact are at risk.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really important part of the message,\u201d he said, \u201cthat when we say contact, we mean 15 to 30 minutes within 6 feet of the person.\u201d\n\nThe CDC website defines close contact as being within approximately 6 feet of an infected person \u201cfor a prolonged period of time\u201d or having direct contact with an infected person\u2019s secretions, such as being coughed on.\n\nNo visitors\nOn Sunday, the Missouri Veterans Commission restricted access to its seven skilled nursing homes spread across Missouri, including one in the St. Louis area north of Bellefontaine Neighbors.\n\nThe veterans commission manages a total 1,238 beds. The other locations include Cameron, Cape Girardeau, Mexico, Mount Vernon, St. James and Warrensburg.\n\n\nNo visitors, vendors nor volunteers are allowed in the facilities until further notice, according to the commission\u2019s website. Staff is helping families communicate with each other via video chat services.\n\nStarting Monday, Williams said, testing kits for COVID-19 will be available commercially. Physicians can order tests for their patients who they determine could be at risk, he said, without having to consult public health officials or meet CDC guidelines that include travel history, known contact and symptoms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s between the physician and the patient,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou can go to the doctor tomorrow and say, \u2018I want a test,\u2019 and they don\u2019t have to use the CDC criteria to order it.\u201d\n\n\nUsing a specific throat swab, doctors can send the sample to a diagnostic lab for testing, Williams said. All positive cases must be reported to local health departments.\n\nThat could mean a dramatic increase in the number of cases reported, Williams acknowledged. With $9.9 million that Missouri will receive under emergency federal legislation approved last week, he said, public health staff will be able to adapt.\n\n\u201cWe are clearly prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nSt. Louis County has partly activated its emergency operations center in Ballwin, bringing together public health experts, paramedics, police, public information officers and hospital officials to provide the latest information and coordinate efforts.\n\nThe center has been activated during natural disasters and other threats, such as the H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009. It was partly activated Friday and on Sunday was teeming with nearly 100 people.\n\n\n\u201cWe must be prepared and educated and ready to respond at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Page stated when the center was activated. \u201cWe have the infrastructure in place, and this is an opportunity to make sure we can collaborate in real time and have the right people at the table.\u201d\n\nAnnika Merrilees and Blythe Bernhard of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.\u201d", "id": "fjzkk78"}, {"subreddit": "singapore", "author": "sneakpeek_bot", "link_id": "t3_f47cfz", "parent_id": "t3_f47cfz", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1581759740, "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "pessimism": false, "optimism": true, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": true, "disgust": false, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "&gt; # Taiwanese doctor shares how to properly make DIY cloth face mask complete with air filter\n\n&gt; With the ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak season in full swing, it\u2019s no surprise that surgical masks are sold out almost everywhere.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; But a Taiwanese anaesthesiologist, Chen Xiaoting, has come up with a free and environmentally friendly recommendation that can save you all the trouble.\n\n&gt; He has resorted to making his own mask and can show you how.\n\n&gt; Making your own face mask using a piece of cloth\n\n&gt; In a Facebook post uploaded on. Feb. 7, Chen showed how he properly makes his own face mask with only a piece of cloth and the help of a tailor.\n\n&gt; Chen said that he first encountered the cloth mask while in a free clinic at the Thai-Myanmar border.\n\n&gt; The staff there had used cloth caps and cloth masks, which meant that they did not produce much medical waste.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt was fresh and an environmentally-friendly concept,\u201d Chen wrote.\n\n&gt; Here are the three simple steps you need to do to make your own cloth mask, according to Chen:\n\n&gt; Pick a cloth that you like. Find a masterful tailor. Give them a disposable mask as a sample for the size and dimensions for the cloth mask.\n\n&gt; The entire process should be completed in 30 minutes.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Non-woven fabric used for filtering\n\n&gt; Chen explained that there was an opening in his cloth mask for a filtering material to fit inside.\n\n&gt; He explained:\n\n&gt; \u201cGeneral surgical masks make use of microfibre melt-blown non-woven fabric. The unique capillary structure makes it a good material for filtering. The surgical mask is made of three layers \u2014 a waterproof non-woven material in front, then a non-woven cloth in the middle, and lastly, a layer of non-woven cloth.\u201d\n\n&gt; However, don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find melt-blown non-woven cloth.\n\n&gt; The usual standard woven cloth and non-woven cloth can make do as well.\n\n&gt; Non-woven cloth includes rags, diapers, gauze, wet tissues and tampons. New ones, of course.\n\n&gt; For Chen, he used a wet tissue, but he dried it before putting it in the mask.\n\n&gt; Chen added that toilet paper is also a good material to use as the filter.\n\n&gt; If you were one of those who hoarded a bunch of toilet rolls, seems like it was worthwhile after all.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Are cloth masks effective?\n\n&gt; In his Facebook post, Chen also shared his responses to questions on whether the cloth masks are effective.\n\n&gt; In terms of hygiene, Chen said that as long as the cloth mask is washed and cleaned daily, you\u2019re good to go.\n\n&gt; But in terms of effectiveness, he stated that even normal surgical masks are not 100 per cent airtight.\n\n&gt; \u201cYou might still take in the air coming in from the side of the mask, unless you\u2019re wearing an N95 mask which is extremely airtight,\u201d he explained.\n\n&gt; However, Chen added that N95 masks should only be worn by those who are in high-risk environments in the medical field.\n\n&gt; It does not need to be worn in a low-risk environment, and those who have heart issues should not wear it at all, he warns.\n\n&gt; He wrote:\n\n&gt; \u201cA few days ago, I saw this old man, he couldn\u2019t breathe properly despite only wearing a surgical mask. He experienced tightness in his chest and was sent to the emergency department.\u201d\n\n&gt; Ultimately, the doctor reiterated the importance of handwashing over putting on a mask.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe virus will likely remain in the environment as droplets for a few days, so washing your hands is so much more important than masking up. Most of my patients are maternity patients who are healthy and have no respiratory symptoms, so this cloth mask is enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; You can read Chen\u2019s full Facebook post here:\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Top images from \u9673\u5c0f\u5ef7/FB.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "id": "fhojb5z"}, {"subreddit": "Coronavirus", "author": "duygusu", "link_id": "t3_fdf5fq", "parent_id": "t1_fjh170i", "complete": true, "created_utc": 1583339559, "emotion": {"anger": false, "anticipation": false, "pessimism": false, "optimism": false, "trust": false, "joy": false, "love": false, "surprise": false, "neutral": true, "disgust": false, "sadness": false, "fear": false}, "body": "In the early days of an infection, the novel coronavirus rapidly invades human lung cells. Those lung cells come in two classes: ones that make mucus and ones with hair-like batons called cilia.\n\nMucus, though gross when outside the body, helps protect lung tissue from pathogens and make sure your breathing organ doesn\u2019t dry out. The cilia cells beat around the mucus, clearing out debris like pollen or viruses.\nFrieman explains that SARS loved to infect and kill cilia cells, which then sloughed off and filled patients\u2019 airways with debris and fluids, and he hypothesizes that the same is happening with the novel coronavirus. That\u2019s because the earliest studies on COVID-19 have shown that many patients develop pneumonia in both lungs, accompanied by symptoms like shortness of breath.\n\nThat\u2019s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.\nWhen working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.\n\u201cSo you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,\u201d Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. \n\nDuring the third phase, lung damage continues to build\u2014which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn\u2019t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage.

Good luck! \n\nVice PM talk on how to fight Covid-19:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q2e4hbKwdPY\n\nBullet points:\n\n- Let's talk about COVID-19. I used to call it \"Corona\". I've heard people calling it \"Chocolate\" (Vietnamese saying it in French \"cho-co-lat\"). But it doesn't matter what its name is. We're facing a very dangerous plague.\n\n- Health organizations praised us, saying we've done better than country A, country B, but we have to keep being serious and humble. We are still trying to containing it.\n\n- The main reason was we were very quick and very strict. All the media reported was on what we did after Lunar New Year. But the fact is we started the measurements since middle December.\n\n- We didn't have any Lunar New Year. I only remember the New Year Eve as the time we started forced quarantine. It was a very serious measurements that we had to explain to and convince everyone, including WHO because at that time no alert had been raised internationally. We were the first one so it wasn't well-received.\n\n- We had planned and prepared for the virus before the PM's order (16th of Jan).\n\n- The process of thought was simple: plan for the worst scenerios to make sure nothing can get worse.\n\n- We have plans for 5 levels of situation. And I ask for all the journalists here that you do not share nor propagandize the level 5 plans. Those are internally used within the government and medical system.\n\n- Level 4 is a situation where Vietnam has 1,000 infected cases. In reality up to now, we can confidently say we can treat up to 3,000 cases.\n\n- Level 5 is a situation where Vietnam has 30,000 cases. But we will not reveal the plans for this and I sincerely ask that you don't propagandize this. Because it can mislead people and make them think it will happen.\n\n- Anyhow, we have plans for all those scenarios, all those levels. In case any of those happens, a single call will start the procedure and the plans will be executed.\n\n- Because Vietnam has no epicenter yet, I use this \"5 fingers\" system to remind myself:\n\n1. We have to prevent the spread with all our might.\n\n2. We have to detect as quickly as possible\n\n3. We have to quarantine right away.\n\n4. We have to triangulate the potential infected zones\n\n5. We have to cure all the infected and disinfect all the virus once detected.\n\n- I joke that this is like treating a fire. We must pour water on the fire so quickly and so effectively that the fire is put out before we even here any sizzle.\n\n- We've decided that this is a global issue. We must work with the world. We will do strong methods that we believe will help, but at the same time we talk and convince the world about it too.\n\n- We've been working on this with China, and now we're working with S.Korea. And Italy, and Iran. We do not know if tomorrow there will be more countries. But we stress that the 5 points I mentioned earlier will not change. We must be determined and patient.\n\n- We know this is an age of information. And in such an age the most important thing is transparency. We've worked with the media to report the most transparent info, not only on the news, but also on social media. The info must be fast and clear.\n\n- Only when the info is fast, clear and true, the people will understand and cooperate to fight against the plague.\n\n- This fight is not only on the Health Ministry, or the Border Patrol. This fight is on every person in the country too.\n\n- This is the first time the whole People Army of Vietnam was deployed nationally.\n\n- I've known that because of news about how Vietnam has cured 16/16 patients, many regions have started being lax. I have to stress that we cannot drop our guard. We shouldn't be overdramatic, but we definitely must not be overconfident.\n\n\u201cFight this plague like we fight a war. And we have won the first campaign. But the war hasn't ended yet. The situation will change and we must be on guard.\"\n\nMarch 1 2020\n\nHCMC plans to build a field hospital near Tan Son Nhat International Airport to check 7,000 Vietnamese returning from South Korea for coronavirus infection.\n\nThe returning people, mostly from southern Vietnam, are among 22,000 Vietnamese working in South Korea, where the number of confirmed cases is second only to China.\n\nHCMC also plans to use the campus of the Vietnam National University \u2013 Ho Chi Minh City in Thu Duc District as a field hospital with a capacity to quarantine 40,000 people if the academic break continues.\n\nThe city received over 6,800 people from South Korea between February 23 and 29.

The church had a presence in Wuhan.\n\nKwon Jun-wook, a KCDC official, confirmed for the first time that some members of the church visited Wuhan during a briefing.

Assuming that they were only the second link in a chain and not somewhere further down, we can see that the people who infected them were infected by end of Jan at the latest estimation, when there was 17 000 infected cases in Hubei, the Chinese authorities hadn\u2019t enacted lockdown on Hubei and prevented Chinese nationals from going to other countries on tours, and the South Korean government didn\u2019t even enact quarantine on all travelers from China. Even if a member of Shincheonji travelling from Wuhan was the only patient 0, the only reason why they would managed to get in and spread the disease undetected in South Korea was because the South Korean government refused to enact proper preventative measures and waited for China to do it for them. And judging from the 4 different alarm bells within 2 weeks, either there wasn\u2019t only 1 patient 0 or there was a super spreader patient 0 undetected. Further genetic testing of the viral strains within the infected population can determine exactly which scenario it was, but as of now, I haven\u2019t come across such report.\n\nTo sum up part 2: The preventative measures to prevent the epidemic from entering the country were either lacking or done poorly, in line with the subsequent poor containment measures and failure to put out the epidemic quickly due to inherent structural problems.\n\nIII.
